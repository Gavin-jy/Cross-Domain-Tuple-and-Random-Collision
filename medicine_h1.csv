• Samsung Phones:

Step 1: Go to settings --> battery --> tap the menu button and choose “Battery optimization” --> tap the dropdown menu at the top of the screen and select “All apps”, then find ""Contraceptive Ring Reminder"", tap it and select “Don’t optimize”.

Step 2: Go to settings --> notifications, then find ""Contraceptive Ring Reminder"", then deactivate ""block all"" and also ""show silently"".

• Huawei Phones:

Step 1: Go to settings --> advanced settings --> battery manager --> protected apps, then find ""Contraceptive Ring Reminder"", and protect it. This is ""whitelisting"" the app so Huawei's overeager software doesn't shut it down for no reason.

Step 2: Go to settings --> apps --> advanced --> ignore battery optimizations, then find ""Contraceptive Ring Reminder"" and ignore it. Don't be tricked by the misleading wording, ""ignoring"" the app actually means to let it run, because you're telling the battery optimization function, aka Doze, to ""ignore"" that app.

Step 3: Go to settings --> notification panel & status bar --> notification center, then find the app, then activate ""allow notifications"" and also ""priority display"". You have to activate the priority part too to make sure you get notifications.

Floor gymnastics can be done outdoors even though it is more common in the room.

"This app is the perfect timer for your workouts. It offers a clear visibility on the clock from far away as well as a simple and beautiful design. 

It is particularly oriented towards crossfit and its type of training (wods) with weights, kettlebells and bodyweight exercises. However you don't need to do crossfit to use this timer, it is also good for other types of training such as running intervals, calisthenics (plank and other static holds) any type of stretching and even regular gym sessions where you need to time your resting periods.

There are 5 different modes of timers:

- 🕒 FOR TIME: As fast as possible for time 
This is a stopwatch that goes up until you stop it (the workout is done) or you reach the time cap or the specified number of rounds.

- ⏳ AMRAP : As Many Reps As Possible 
This is a timer that counts down until the time is expired. You set the time during which you want to exercise and it counts down until it reaches zero.

- 🕒 EMOM: Every Minute On the Minute
This timer will count down every interval you set for the number of rounds you provide. The interval can be changed, it can be an EMOM or E3MOM for example. 

- ⏰ TABATA - High Intensity Intervals training (HIIT) - Circuit training:
This mode will alternate between work time and rest time for the specified number of rounds. You can configure the work and rest intervals and the total number of rounds. It is ideal for cardio workouts such as x mins ON and x sec off.

- 🕒 CUSTOM: Creates your own custom timer sequences 
This mode allows you to create your own sequence of workout time and exercise time. It's useful if the EMOM or TABATA ones are not flexible enough. Perfect for conditioning or cardio wods!
You can also add your own custom name such as ""Running"" or ""warmup"" in these sequences, the stopwatch will display the next interval name.

You can pause the clock at any time and resume the workout you were doing if you need to take a water break or maybe adjusting the weights.

This app also works in background and allows you to get notified of new intervals or simply keep track of the time with a notification when your phone is locked.

Workout timer also offers:

 - A countdown before any clocks starts so you have time to set up your exercise and jump on that rower or bike!
 - Round counter for the FOR TIME and AMRAP modes so you can keep track of how many rounds you have done so far (no need for poker chips anymore) and the split times for every round.
- You get notified 3 seconds in advance when the new round is about to start (in EMOM, TABATA and CUSTOM) so you can get ready for it. When a new interval is coming, the clock will change color so you can see it from far away.
- Huge digits in landscape mode so you can see it from far away while lifting weights.

This interval timer is suited for any kind of sports and is particularly relevant for high-intensity interval training like crossfit wods, you can get notified very easily while working out (when the workout starts, when a new interval is about to start, when the workout ends) with:

- A clock sound (pretty much like a real crossfit clock 😍)
- A phone vibration - useful when doing running intervals and holding your phone for example
- A flashlight blink signal every round (android 6.0+) - useful when your phone is far away and you can't put the sound on for example

Happy training and good wods with your new wod timer!"

"""Want to Learn How to Survive Military Basic Training!
Boot Camp: Learn about Army Basic Training.

Military Basic Training often called boot camp prepares recruits for all elements of service: physical, mental and emotional. 
It gives service members the basic tools necessary to perform the roles that will be asked of them for the duration of their tour. Each of the Services has its own training program, tailoring the curriculum to the specialized nature of its role in the Military.

No matter which branch of the Service a recruit chooses, Army Basic Training is an intense experience. 
However, 90 percent complete their first six months of service. The purpose of this training isn’t to “break” recruits. 

In fact, the combination of physical training, field exercises and classroom time makes individuals strong and capable. It’s a tough process, but a rewarding one that many service members value for life.

To succeed in boot camp, young adults should prepare themselves physically and mentally. Daily cardio, weight training, push ups and sit ups are a must. 
They should also practice arriving early on a regular basis and sticking to a strict schedule.

Nervous about boot camp? Sergeant Michael Volkin tells you what to expect in these army basic training application videos."""

"A word from the developer: Working out consistently has always been a struggle for me until someone introduced me to the 100-Day Burpees challenge. 

For the first time, I managed to work out consistently for 87 days in a row. On day 88, food poisoning put an end to my challenge and I didn't make it to 100 days. 

The good news is that I'm now ready to start again with a great new app to track my progress.

I built this app for different reasons: 
1. It will push me to continue working out because I love challenging myself and keep track of my progress.
2. It will help folks that struggle to get back into shape by offering them easy workouts that can be done at home without any gear or equipment. 
3. If you're a competitor at heart, it's a great tool to gamify your workouts with friends.

Whether your goal is to lose weight, get fitter or build muscle, you can shape your challenge to suit your level and preferences.

Here is how it works: 

1. Pick an exercise: burpees, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, kneeing push-ups, lunges, jumping jacks, mountain climber...
2. Select the length of your challenge: 3, 7, 10, 30, 60, 90 or 100 days.
3. (Optional) Set a number of reps you will add every day (+1 per day is recommended for beginners), but you can also pick 0 to keep the same amount of reps per day throughout your challenge.
4. Select the number of reps you will do on day one. (start small, especially for longer challenges)

That leaves you with a challenge that could look like this: 

- Starting with 5 burpees today, I will do five more burpees every day for the next 10 days.
- Starting with 1 push-up today, I will do one more push-up every day for the next 30 days.
- I will do 7 jumping jacks every day for 7 days.
- ... 

The key is not to smash huge sessions straight away. You need to get your body used to move. And starting with a minuscule amount of efforts is the best way to fight procrastination. 

I remember when I started my 100-day burpee challenge a few months ago... I just decided to start, did 1 burpee and I was done for the day. The next day, I did two burpees and I was done for the day. And with small incremental progress like that... I slowly started gaining strength and felt better in my body.

If you would have told me I would be able to do 87 burpees in a row when I started, I would have never believed it. 

So that's the key... start with dead-easy goals, show up every day and do a little more every day. 

Important rule built in these challenges: If you miss your reps on a specific day, you need to catch up on the next day. So if you had to do 10 push-ups today, and tomorrow you are meant to do 11, but you skip today somehow. You will have to do 21 push-ups tomorrow. This built-in rule is a great way to keep yourself committed and motivated do show up every day. 

I hope you will like what I came up with. All feedback, suggestions can be sent to me on this email: edouard.developer@gmail.com and you can also find me on Instagram at @edouard_iosdev. I occasionally share my burpees session in my Stories so definitely be on the lookout for that. 

Happy workouts people.

Cheers, 
Ed

"The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a multiple-choice self-report inventory copyrighted by Pfizer Inc, that is used as a screening and diagnostic tool for mental health disorders of depression, anxiety, alcohol, eating, and somatoform.

It is the self-report version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), a diagnostic tool developed in the mid-1990s by Pfizer Inc."
"Pregnancy test - Pregnancy symptoms is an app with a complete questionnaire, which will help you to know whether you might be pregnant, based on the main early symptoms of pregnancy.

Here you will find a pregnancy quiz with 15 questions, which correspond to the main early signs of pregnancy and with which you will obtain an approximate percentage, which can serve as an orientation to know whether you are pregnant.

If you ask yourself: Am I pregnant? In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the ""Am I pregnant quiz"" we have prepared.

Main characteristics:
- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.
- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.
- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.

Which kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?
As we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.
If you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.
If, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.

Note: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.

"Do you experience imbalances in your life? Do you feel that you are not living at your maximum level? Are you bogged down by constant health problems? Well, your chakras could be out of balance. 

This Free 7 Chakra Meditation for Body Healing and Cleansing app will help you to perform chakra activation and manage your energy within your body. This app includes all 7 chakra meditations audio and 3 special categories;

1. Root Chakra
2. Sacral Chakra
3. Solar Plexus Chakra
4. Heart Chakra
5. Throat Chakra
6. Third Eye Chakra

Honestly, the chakras are the energy centers of the human bodies which act as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. So can you improve the quality of your life by balancing these energy vortices? Well yes! But before we explore the benefits of balancing the chakras and how to do it, let's get to know the chakras in brief.

What are chakras?

A chakra is a Sanskrit word that means wheel. In yoga and meditation, the chakras are wheels or discs located all over the body. There are seven main chakras aligned with the spine. They start from the base of the spine and move in a straight line, along the spine, through the crown. When energy flows unobstructed through these energy centers, your body, mind, and soul will appreciate the coordination and good health. Any obstruction to this flow could harm your overall well-being.

How does chakra healing work?

A series of major and minor energy centers - called chakras - exist in the body. The chakras are the energy centers of the physical body, where your beliefs and emotions are transformed into your state of health.

Your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs affect the health of your tissues and organs, and this can be ""seen"" in the chakras. Trauma, negative feelings and thoughts can lodge in the chakras and create a blockage (illness) that will hinder the flow of energy. When we do not allow a healthy flow of energy, due to negative thoughts and emotions, we feel tired and weakened, and then we develop a form of illness. Chakra healing consists of releasing the internal resistance that exists within the chakras in order to obtain optimal health.

What is chakra healing for?

In the most basic sense, chakra healing is used for those who need energy (this includes anemic or malnourished people), although its use is also much broader, as it is not only used to treat illnesses. , but also as a preventive measure commonly practiced by those who adhere to its philosophy.

What are the benefits of healing the chakra?

Healing through the chakra is said to be able to cure almost any mental illness or disease. The process restores balance for each of the chakra sites, as it is believed that if the chakra has too much or too little energy, it will not function properly. The East Indian philosophy behind the healing of the chakras states that body and mind are connected and that a healthy body is a body in which the energies associated with each chakra are balanced and in harmony."

"Using phones or tablet for a long time leads to eye strain and affect your sleep, Screen Filter is a free app used to reduce blue light by adjusting the screen to natural color.

🔴 In first use please make sure to set device brightness to 15% at least, then enable the filter and set your settings.

🔴 Please turn off the filter before installing other apps or taking screenshots.


More tips to protect your eyes:
1️⃣ Limit screen time when you are not working. It is impossible to avoid digital devices in the workplace, but you can reduce the amount of time you spend on electronics when you are not working. Digital devices often provide a passive “escape” from reality that seems enjoyable, but it can be a poor use of your time and can just increase eye fatigue and muscle strain.

2️⃣ If you use your devices at night, download a blue light filter app. There are several free apps in your App Store that will put a filter on the screen of your smartphone or tablet to reduce glare at night. This will help reduce eye fatigue.

3️⃣ Try not to use your devices directly before bedtime. Overexposure to blue light can cause restlessness and insomnia. Set a limit of turning off your devices at least one hour before bedtime and charge your devices in a different room so you are not tempted to turn them back on.

4️⃣ Blink, blink, blink. One reason that we are more susceptible to dry eye when using electronics is that our blink rate is reduced significantly.  Put a post-it note on your computer screen that says “Blink”! Blinking more often will keep your eyes moist and refreshed.

5️⃣ Get regular comprehensive eye exams. There is no substitute for an eye exam by a licensed specialist. Schedule regular eye exams to ensure your vision stays clear and healthy. You can also talk to your ophthalmologist about prescribing protective lenses with blue light filters to reduce eye strain.

"Musculoskeletal X- Rays Interpretation
x-ray interpretation guide app

Musculoskeletal X-ray - General principles :
Systematic approach
Patient and image details
Bone and joint alignment
Joint spacing in x-ray interpretation
Cortical outline
Bone texture in chest x ray interpretation
Soft tissues
Although the system for viewing X-rays of bones and joints varies depending on the anatomy being examined, there are some broad principles which can be applied in a number of situations.A systematic approach involves checking alignment of bone structures, joint spacing, integrity of bone cortex, medullary bone texture, and for abnormalities of any visible surrounding soft tissue structures.
Patient and image details in dental x ray interpretation
Start by checking you are looking at the correct image. The patient's details should be checked and the date and time of the X-ray noted. The skeletal system is symmetrical, so it is particularly important to be sure you are looking at the correct side.
Bone and joint alignment
Loss of alignment may be due to a bone fracture or a joint dislocation. Both are associated with soft tissue injury that may not be directly visualised.

Joint spacing may be narrowed due to cartilage loss or widened due to dislocation/dissociation.

Cortical outline
Careful scrutiny of the bone cortex is required because a check that is too brief will lead to incorrect or incomplete diagnosis.In the context of trauma the clinical features of a significant injury may be masked by other injuries. Remember to be systematic, and if you spot one abnormality, do not stop until you are sure you have focused on all areas of the anatomy shown.

Bone texture
In some bones a fine matrix of fine white lines (trabeculae) is seen. Occasionally bone injury or disease will result in abnormality of this texture.

Soft tissues
Scrutinizing the soft tissues can often provide helpful information.Not uncommonly an abnormality of soft tissues is more obvious than a bone injury, or may even imply a bone injury that is not visible at all.

Confidence in assessing musculoskeletal system X-rays comes from experience and a knowledge of normal appearances. All patients are different, so being sure of the distinction between normal and abnormal is often difficult.Here are some principles that may help you to determine if a finding is normal.

2 views
In the context of trauma at least 2 views of the body part in question are usually required. If looking for specific disease entities, for example erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, this may be less important. In some cases, such as possible scaphoid injury, more than 2 images are required.2 views are better than 1

Compare with other side
Images of the asymptomatic contralateral side to a suspected abnormality are not routinely acquired for assessment of all bones or joints.If an old image of the contralateral side is available, or if the other side is included as standard (for example hip/pelvis), then comparison between symptomatic and asymptomatic appearances can be very helpful.

Compare current with previous images
The 'old X-ray' is said to be the 'cheapest test in radiology.'
If you are uncertain of an abnormality and there is an old image available of the area in question, then ALWAYS look at it. Doing this often increases diagnostic confidence, and can show progression of pathology over time.

Keep your eye on the ball
When looking at an X-ray always keep the current clinical features at the forefront of your mind.Remember - 'Treat the patient and not the X-ray!'

Look for the unexpected
Not all disease that presents with musculoskeletal symptoms is primarily related to pathology of the bones or joints. Very often pain is referred to the symptomatic area and is explained by disease of another system.For example, shoulder pain is usually due to shoulder pathology, but always keep in mind that pain may be referred to the shoulder from the cervical spine, brachial plexus or diaphragm."

GI means Glycemic Index. It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.

The Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.

Net carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.

BMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.

Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.

Hyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.

Observational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health."

"Now is the time to stay home and improve your inner health and stay focused and motivational. We offer a variety of mental and emotional quotes so you can read them at home and stay safe and healthy.

Memory or Mind Games are logic games to train your memory and attention. While playing our brain games, you not only get a lot of fun but also gradually improve your memory, attention, and concentration. Practicing a new and challenging activity is a good bet for building and maintaining cognitive skills.

Your brain has the ability to learn and grow as you age, a process called brain plasticity. But, for it to do so, you have to train it on a regular basis.
Eventually, your cognitive skills will wane and thinking and memory will be more challenging, so you need to build up your reserve. Embracing a new activity that also forces you to think and learn and requires ongoing practice can be one of the best ways to keep the brain healthy.

Physical and mental game:
Research has shown that regular physical exercise is one way to improve cognitive functions like memory recall, problem-solving, concentration, and attention to detail. However, it is not clear if the physical aspect alone boosts your brain or if a combination of other factors like the mental challenge of the activity, the frequency you do it, and the desire to improve also contribute.

Take swimming, for example. It has obvious cardiovascular and muscle-building benefits, but also involves constant thinking, processing, and learning. You have to be mindful of your breathing rhythm and how to properly execute strokes and kicks. You also can measure your expertise in terms of endurance and speed, which motivates you to practice your skills to be a better swimmer.

A brain-training activity doesn't always have to be exercise-related. Much research has found that creative outlets like painting and other art forms, learning an instrument, doing expressive or autobiographical writing, and learning a language also can improve cognitive function. A 2014 study in Gerontologist reviewed 31 studies that focused on how these specific endeavors affected older adults' mental skills and found that all of them improved several aspects of memory like recalling instructions and processing speed.

Do the right activity:
No matter which new activity you choose, make sure it follows three guidelines in order to maximize brain training:

Challenging: 
You have to always challenge your brain in order for it to grow. This is why choosing a new activity is so beneficial. It engages your brain to learn something new and offers the chance to improve.
Not up for a new endeavor? Raise the bar for an existing activity. For instance, if you are a casual golfer, commit to increasing your ability and aim to lower your handicap or shoot a specific score. You don't have the challenge of learning something new, but rather the challenge of increasing your skillset and knowledge.

Complexity:
A complex activity not only strikes a match of excitement, but forces your brain to work on specific thought processes like problem-solving and creative thinking. A 2013 study in Psychological Science found that older adults ages 60 to 90 who did new and complex activities, such as digital photography or quilting, for an average of 16 hours per week for three months scored better on working and long-term memory tests than those who did more familiar activities like reading and doing crossword puzzles.

Practice:
Practice makes permanent, and that goes for brain function, too. The more time you devote to engaging your brain, the more it benefits.
Your activity should require some level of constant practice, but the goal is not to strive for vast improvements. It is the constant repetition of working to improve, and not the quest for mastery, that can have the greatest impact."
"Eyes feel tired during night reading on the phone?

Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:

1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.

2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.

3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.

4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.

5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.

6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.

"If you're looking to push your calorie burning, fat-busting HIIT workouts to the next level, you should start skipping.

Not days in the gym, of course. Just skip out on the weights in favor of one of the most efficient pieces of equipment you probably laying around: the jump rope.

Jump Rope HIIT Workout Routines to Burn Fat and Train Cardio
At-home cardio workouts can be easier than you think—especially if you have a jump rope. A jump rope workout can be a fun and challenging way to get in your cardio when you have to stay in one place. Jumping rope can help maximize your workout, even if you only have a few minutes. It seriously challenges the cardiovascular system while also helping to improve coordination and muscle strength.

Can't muster the motivation to make it to the gym? Skip it! Jumping rope burns more than 10 calories a minute while strengthening your legs, butt, shoulders, and arms. And it doesn't take long to reap great rewards. You can burn more than 200 calories in two 10-minute sessions each day (yep... that's 1000 calories a week).

Jumping rope (also referred to as rope skipping) is a staple in a boxer's conditioning program. 
Jumping rope is also a great way to fit in an effective cardio session when you're on the go—just toss your jump rope in your carry-on! You'll probably feel completely energized after jumping rope too.

Try adding our workout routines to your existing strength plan, or do it alone as a cardio workout. Add a jump rope to high intensity interval training (HIIT), and you're in for a hell of a workout. Jumping rope is a great way to burn off those extra calories while getting in a full body workout. 

Jump Rope Weight Loss Routine - Home Cardio HIIT Program
One of the best methods to get in a fast, efficient workout is to use jump rope for your HIIT endurance routine. And while running is a popular choice when it comes to HIIT workouts, there are several reasons to pick up a jump rope instead.

What are you waiting for? Hop to it!
We offer short, intense home workouts that combines intervals of cardio, using a jump rope, with bodyweight strength training moves."

"■■■ Why do you train your trunk? ■■■
""Wake up, sleep, stand, sit, walk, run, throw, pick up""
The “trunk” is greatly involved in these movements that are usually performed without being conscious. However, if the trunk is not consciously trained, it will become weak and distorted.

""Faster and easier""
If you solidify your trunk, your body will perform better than you think. When climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, it is possible to transmit force more efficiently if the body axis and trunk are solid.

""Cooler and more beautiful""
Mobility and stability. Strengthening the trunk leads to dynamic, stable and beautiful movements.

■■■ Difficulty in training the trunk ■■■
I would like to say “I only have practice” after learning about the benefits of training the trunk, but in fact it is quite difficult to use it with awareness of the trunk.

During training, it is important to be aware of the trunk in your movements, not just as described in the illustrations. More importantly, it is important to be aware of every action in daily life, not just during training.

"Are you a Powerlifter,  into Crossfit, or just a gym rat?  You need this app!.  Take it to the gym with you to make sure you are calculating your lift numbers correctly.  This app is completely free and does not have any ads.  We built this app for ourselves.  We wanted the ultimate tool for getting the best powerlifting results possible and wanted to share it with everyone who is looking for the same thing.  Press the info button to communicate directly with us with ideas to improve the tool.  What are you waiting for, it is free.

One rep maximum (1RM) in weight training is the max amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise.  One repetition maximum can be used for determining an individual's maximum strength and is the method for determining the winner in events such as powerlifting and weightlifting competitions. 

One repetition maximum can also be used as an upper limit, in order to determine the desired ""load"" for an exercise (as a percentage of the 1RM).

With the 1 Rep Max app, you can enter the amount of weight you lifted on a movement and the number of reps to calculate your 1 rep max and various percentages of your one rep max.

For example you lifted 200lbs 3 times.  Using this information you can calculate that your max is approximately 212lbs.

This app also can be used to quickly determine a percentage of your one rep max.  Many weight programs will tell you to lift 65% of your 1RM for 5 sets of 8 reps.  Using the example max from above you can determine that your max is 212 and then click over to 65% and see that you need to lift 138 in this workout.

Use this in conjunction with the Mainsite Track app also available in the app store to create custom workouts.

If you enjoy using 1RepMax, please take a minute to leave a nice review: it really helps!"

"My dear, how long have you been asleep when you have grown up listening to your mother's lullaby? You may not need to listen to your mother's lullaby and sleep on drugs, dear. My dear, you may have not slept early for a long time, and always stay up until two o'clock every night. Dear, I just want to send you a lullaby to let you sleep well tonight and later.

At last, I ended up working for a day, but you were still sleepless with all kinds of life and work pressure and sleepless all night. I remember a woman writer who used to describe insomnia, ""insomnia like a black smoke in a small Arabian bottle, hanging over my head,"" the suffering and suffering of a person. According to reports of adults at least one day to get eight hours of sleep, the body will be able to maintain health. If you're suffering from insomnia, put on your headphones and turn down the volume, starting from Schubert's opera ""nocturne"", relaxing, breathing gently, and slowly entering a sweet dream with the soothing music.

Music has its own story, just like the people we listen to music. If we can resonate, it must be music that infects our thoughts and emotions.

Some melody, although sad, but can make confusion become calm. The grayish style is indescribably touching.

There is always a song suitable for you to go to sleep, tender and warm serenade, tell music to yourself at night, and let yourself sleep peacefully.

The white noise of magic has amazing characteristics. It is like a white beam, composed of all colors, and we see white light. It's a question that some people might ask, what does white noise sound like? Can we really feel that a lot of people who have been treated with white noise say they sound like a sound of rain, or the sound of a wave like a wave beating a rock, or like a wind blowing the rustle of a leaf. This kind of voice can play a certain role of voice therapy for people of all ages. It is a kind of ""harmonious"" treatment voice.

In fact, sometimes what you need is not text

Just some melodious melody ear.

It will flow between your heart and your heart

The sound of wind, rain, waves, insects, birds and frogs can make you feel like sleeping in a mountain or a wooden house near the beach, letting go of all troubles and sleeping quietly.

Timed off function, let you sleep in the music with confidence. (Timed shutdown requires IAP)"

"Almost all of the ladies are worried about their hips and thighs. At the beginning of the ladies' physical problems comes the big head and hip. There are a variety of ways to reduce these to normal, but the best and most important is to exercise. Some people think that they can not be reached at one time by the melting exercises that are going on at home, but this is wrong. Without exercise, you can never reach fit with  methods like shock diets. You can only achieve the measurements you imagine by regularly applying the movements in our ""hip and basen exercises"" exercise. You can apply the movements at any time during the day. Do not be too hungry or too crowded when doing thawing movements. With at least two liters of water per day with the movements, you will make an extra contribution to burning fat. As a nutrition, you can speed up your hip and thawing process with slight changes such as choosing bulgur instead of white rice, whole grain bread instead of white bread,  eating not heavy meals after 7 o'clock in the evening. Start by doing 1 week in 2 days, you can do it every day after the reception. But the most important element is that you do it regularly. It's not too difficult, you can even do it by watching television, it takes you up to 15-20 minutes.
The size of the hip, which is a problem of regional fatigue, is not a problem to be solved by diet alone. For this reason, while these diets are being applied, they should be exercised at the same time to achieve success of the hip dissolving process. The exercises should be continued on a regular basis so that the fat in the hips melts and a desired hip size can be reached. In addition, the exercises will allow your body to stay in shape, and the fat and fat parts will be regularly lubricated. To give a few examples;
- The first exercise to be done between the hip melting movements is walking on a daily basis. It is extremely important and effective to make the walk on a regular basis on a daily basis. If these walks are done regularly, you will soon notice the effect.
- As another hip-melting exercise, you can do cycling exercises. The bicycle exercise, which has a great effect on the base and the hips, is the number one exercise to dissolve the desired region.
- At the same time, gymnastics movements are also a very effective exercise method for hip dissolving. This movement of exercise, which circles and makes your hip functional in a big way, is one of the best ways to dissolve your hip.
 - Another effective way to burn excess oils in your bases and thighs is to do weight exercises. Your leg movements, which you will do by lifting the weight, are quite effective in quickly burning calories. This exercise, while preventing oiling, also burns fat.
- Another hip fusion is performed in the crawling position. While one leg is standing on your knee, lift your other leg up and down in an upright position. You must repeat this movement 10 times in 3 sets.
- Another hip dissolving action is performed while standing. Open your legs about a meter. Make it stand out as if you were stepping on a pant later. Hold your hands at your waist. Twist your back to 90 degrees and bend it so that you do not touch your knee. Get up later. Tightening the heels and legs is a very effective exercise in calorie burning.
You can visually find all of this and more in our practice of ""hip and basen exercises"", and you can apply every field by carrying it with you at any time. Now download our ""hip and basen exercises"" application and remove the joy.

"What is tinnitus?

Tinnitus is the perception of a sound within the ear, without a real sound being actually emitted from outside the auricle.

Some people do not find this condition to be of disturbance, while for others it can be extremely annoying as it is perceived as a constant whistle, buzz in the head or hiss that distracts the brain and diverts its capacity of concentration from everyday tasks.

The ear's educational treatments for tinnitus are based on sound therapy. During the latter, the patient listens to an artificially generated sound as similar as possible to the one his ear perceives for 4 to 6 hours a day. This sound masking mitigates the perception of sound, re-establishing a new threshold to auditory experiences.

If the audio treatment is continued for 6 weeks straight, the symptoms of tinnitus are lessened considerably, and even appear to disappear completely.

How to use this app

Tinnitus Relief Sound Masking System is avery modern system to find your tinnitus and provide a remedy. Wear some headphones. Select a masking sound from the list, choosing the one that most of all resembles the one perceived by your ears.

The app has a library of noises available to mask your ear noise (7 are free, the others can be unlocked with the “Premium” package). You can find 5 environmental noises, 9 beep sounds (from 174 to 963 Hz), white and pink noises, 6 ambiental and nature noises (air conditioning, fan, hair dryer, vacuum cleaner, rain and water sounds).

"Generally speaking, the screens on smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, and other LED screens emit a blue light. This light can be harmful to your vision, especially when you expose yourself directly to it at night or when there isn't any sunlight. Bluelight Blocking is an application that helps you avoid this light by manually modifying the type of light emitted by these screens.

The first thing you have to do is adjust the transparency filters according to what you want for different occasions. The higher the filter level, the more opaque and less lit-up the screen will be, so you can read, play, or work without your eyes watering or drying out. When you want to change this value, all you have to do is slide the bar to the position that you want.

The selection of filters to choose from is enough to find the best choice for each moment: red, yellow, brown, and black are the four possibilities. When you activate one of them, you can see how the blue light becomes less harmful and easier on the eyes. You'll also be consuming less resources, so you won't burn through your battery quite as fast as long as you have Bluelight Blocking activated.

To access this application more quickly, you can set up a shortcut on the configuration menu. This way, if you want to have a shortcut to the notifications panel, you can have it display when the the filter is activated, when it's deactivated, or always. Adjust your screen and stop hurting your vision, whether it's during the day or at night.

Why should we care about blue light?

Blue light is part of visible light spectrum that we are exposed to it by the sun every day. However, nighttime exposure to the light at high levels by smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other LED screens may impair your vision. 

It also suppresses the production of hormone melatonin, which hinders your body's natural sleep cues.

When your melatonin level and sleep cycle are disrupted, your risk of a wide range of ailments, from depression to cancer, may go up.

You can get help by using apps that limit the amount of blue light coming from our screens.

※ When trying to download other apps you need from other than Google Play Store, sometimes they are not installed properly with the bluelight filter is activated. In such case, please turn off the bluelight filter for a moment and install other applications.

※ Battery consumption is low when the filter is applied, due to low total CPU usage except for low CPU usage."

Medical authorities around the world have agreed that 10,000 is a healthy number for which to aim! The American Heart Association uses the 10,000 steps metric as a guideline to follow for decreasing risk of heart disease, the #1 killer of men and women in America.

By taking 10,000 steps a day, that is a rough equivalent to the Surgeon General’s recommendation to accumulate 30 minutes of activity per day.  This will help reduce your risk for disease and help you lead a longer, healthier life! Some of the many benefits include: lower BMI, reduced waist size, increased energy, and less risk for Type II diabetes and heart disease.

See A Food's True Cost
Did you know you need to go for a 90 minute walk just to burn off the calories contained in a single slice of pizza? CARROT will convert a food's calories into terms you can actually understand, like how many miles you'll need to run to work off a donut. 

Feel The Burn
Keep your avatar from blimping up by logging your workouts. CARROT imported a wide variety of activities into her database, including Running, LARPing, and Laser Tag.

Get Yelled At For Opening The Fridge
Stick an iBeacon sensor inside your fridge, and CARROT will remind you to log your foods whenever you get near. But be careful - if you’re already over your calorie goal, CARROT will blare an alarm.

Quake In Fear Of Punishment
Overeat, and CARROT will serve up brutal punishments like bribe requests, hideous fullscreen ads, and tweets that will shame you in front of all your social media pals.

- Scan barcodes for lightning-fast logging

💟They can be said as a single figure (eg 10243 ten thousand two hundred and forty three)

💟They can be said as a one at a time (one, zero, two, four, three)

💟You can repeat as many times a day as you like, nor is there any rule.

💟The number of days that you make them depends on you, they are usually done until you manifest what you are asking for, there are other codes such as connection with the Earth, etc. that it would be wonderful to always do them.

💟They can be done at any time and in any place.

💟Gratitude is very important, once the sacred code is finished, since we are manifesting the faith that we have, that we have already received the grace.

💟That is the effective gratitude that generates the high vibrations, since it is enhanced by the faith that we have already received it.

"How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind?  Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self esteem and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.

Positive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.

An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.
The more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.

As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.

And the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.
There are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:
- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. 
- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. 
- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.

Thunderstorm sounds is the use of sounds to improve health or functional outcomes. Rain therapy is a creative arts therapy, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses melodies and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health.

While our rain noise provides a lot of rain, and just a touch of thunder rumble in the lower register, our thunder noise generator is the opposite: a lot of thunder, and just the right amount of rain to fill in the higher frequencies. The rain on Distant Thunder is slightly more dynamic too, offering subtle variations over time, which is how rain should sound below thunderclouds.

Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world, or material world. ""Nature"" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic.

The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.

Sound is a mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing. Sound also travels through plasma.

Sound is a sequence of waves of pressure that propagates through compressible media such as air or water. (Sound can propagate through solids as well, but there are additional modes of propagation). Sound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. In air at standard temperature and pressure, the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17 m to 17 mm. During propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attenuated by the medium.

Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation, or by a range of other methods.
Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water, or ""safe for bathing"". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water)."

"Banting is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet, named after William Banting, the first person to do it. It’s been made popular by Professor Tim Noakes in his book The Real Meal Revolution. The idea is that this way of eating makes your body switch from burning carbs for energy to burning fat.

Banting diets can aid weight loss and are linked to a growing number of health benefits. A reduced carb intake can positively impact those with various health issues, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, acne, PCOS and Alzheimer’s disease.

The eating plan emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods like fish, eggs, low-carb vegetables and nuts and discourages highly processed, packaged items. Added sugar and starchy foods like bread, pasta, potatoes and rice are restricted.

The LCHF diet doesn't have clear standards for macronutrient percentages since it’s more of a lifestyle change. Daily carb recommendations on this diet can range from under 20 grams up to 100 grams. However, even those consuming more than 100 grams of carbs per day can follow the diet and be inspired by its principles, as it can be personalized to meet individual needs.

Studies now show that there’s no reason to fear natural fats. Fat is your friend On a low-carb diet, you instead minimize your intake of sugar and starches. You can eat other delicious foods until you are satisfied – and still lose weight.

"Everyone wishes to have flawless skin. Skin acts as a protective barrier from the outside environment. Skin color mainly depends on its pigment, called melanin, produced in the skin cells called melanocytes. The more melanin pigment melanocytes produce, the darker the skin will be.

Skin tone can darken from tanning or as a result from exposure to sun rays. UV rays damage and darken skin. Prolonged exposure to polluted air, hormonal imbalances, heavy usage of cosmetics, ageing, unbalanced diet, stress, heredity, certain environmental factors, dry skin, genetics, certain medical conditions, and improper lifestyle choice, are all potential causes of dark skin.

Using chemical-loaded cosmetics for skin lightening can get expensive and be harmful to your skin over time. Natural home remedies are much more cost effective and are safe for your body. Download this application to give you tips to naturally lighten dark skin."

What is ICD?

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes. This includes the analysis of the general health situation of population groups. It is used to monitor the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems, proving a picture of the general health situation of countries and populations.

ICD is used by physicians, nurses, other providers, researchers, health information managers and coders, health information technology workers, policy-makers, insurers and patient organizations to classify diseases and other health problems recorded on many types of health and vital records, including death certificates and health records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic information for clinical, epidemiological and quality purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States. Finally, ICD is used for reimbursement and resource allocation decision-making by countries.

All Member States use the ICD which has been translated into 43 languages. Most countries (117) use the system to report mortality data, a primary indicator of health status.

ICD-10 was endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly in May 1990 and came into use in WHO Member States as from 1994. ICD is currently under revision, through an ongoing Revision Process, and the release date for ICD-11 is 2018.

There is a saying “If you give the man a fish, you feed him for one day, but if you teach him to fish, you feed him for entire life”
We at diet Kundali believe that the best way to bring positive changes in people’s health is to educate them the secret of good health – The Balance!
Take an example of a pregnant lady who wants to know what to eat during pregnancy? Instead of giving a standard diet chart if she is told about her nutritional status and if she can be educated about aspects of different nutrients in pregnancy period, she will wisely choose foods that will complete the nutritional gap. Not only this, she would take care of eating habits of entire family.
How healthy your body stay is a direct function of what you eat. If you are taking only few nutrients from diet or food supplements there will not be a significant difference to your health because nutrients need company of other nutrients to work effectively, a group of nutrients can have a have great positive effect on the health.
Diet Kundali gives you Nutritional status. With the nutritional status you can project the health-related issues in future. Diet Kundali produces the nutritional status of more than 24 nutrients based on the eating pattern of a family. This can help you balance specific nutrients that is creating nutritional gap or important in a disease or health condition thus, making your diet plan more goal oriented.

Time has come to look beyond carbs and fats. Analysis of your food nutrients is critical task to set on the path of good health. And if you want to achieve optimal health, then Diet Kundali is the stepping stone for you. Sit down and buckle up. Get your notepad and log the monthly ration and eating pattern of your family. Log on to generate your nutritional status."

"***Losing your Fitbit or Fitness Tracker can be a costly event! Save Time and Money!!!***For fitness band wearers ( Garmin, Galaxy, Xiao mi, etc. ), there is nothing worse than losing it! Having the ability to check your phone for where your fitness band might be hiding could save you some big headaches! 

To locate your lost Fitbit or fitness band device this app has THREE APPS IN ONE to increase your chances of finding your missing device. How cool is that!?

FEATURES:

TWO BLUETOOTH PROXIMITY FINDERS:
There are two finder/radar functions to find your missing device using Bluetooth low energy proximity. These finder functions show hints, signal strength, and estimate the distance between you and your lost device to help find it for you quickly.

LAST KNOWN LOCATION FUNCTION:
The app also has a last known location (last seen/detected) function to show your missing device on a map.

=>> Simply use the finding features to find the proximity and location of your lost device!

NOTES:

BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY:
The Signal Percentage Radar and Radial Finder work with any BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 and up) device. 
Your fitness band must be powered on and emitting BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to be found with these two features. 

GPS AND BATTERY LIFE:
Regarding the Last Known Location function:
Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

SIGNAL PERCENTAGE RADAR:
The closer you are to your missing device, the higher the Bluetooth low energy signal percentage. Move around to increase the percentage and you will find your missing device very quickly!

RADIAL FINDER:
The closer you get to your missing device the further the radial indicator will move to the right. Once you can move around to get the radial indicator to move to the right the furthest as possible, then your device is very close, have a look and you will find it!

LAST KNOWN LOCATION OF DEVICE:
Firstly, be sure to accept location permissions “While in Use” and later “Always”, when arriving on this screen. This is to ensure that your device’s last known location can be recorded in case you lose your device. This feature can track your device’s last known location in case you lost it and it is outside reach of the Signal Percentage Radar or Radial Finder (these two features work by Bluetooth low energy proximity only)."

"Splits Training is designed for all levels to get full splits step by step, even if you are a beginner. The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you improve flexibility effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With just 10 min a day, you’ll get closer and closer to the floor!

Productive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, no equipment needed.

Whether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.

Why splits?
Splits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.

Improve your flexibility & balance
Flexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.

Loosen your hip flexors
Due to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.

Deeply stretch your legs
When doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.

Please get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.

"Having trouble with a porn addiction is a real thing, and not many people are willing to admit that. It is a way of life for many people, but some do not understand how much of an impact being a porn addict has on your life. Watching porn changes the way that you view the world and changes the way that you view women for the worse!

Porn Addiction Calendar addresses the need to stop watching porn, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Track how much money and time you have saved since you quit watching porn.
3. Create your own reasons to quit watching porn, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
4. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.
5. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop the porn abuse.
6. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.
7. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.
8. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of the porn abuse and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.
9. Porn Addiction Calendar automatically calculates how much money you have saved since you quit watching porn.
10. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake dependence on porn.
 
 
Here are our top 7 reasons to stop watching porn now:
1. Porn addiction destroys your sex life
 
You may have heard that watching porn with a partner can ignite a more satisfying sex life, but countless hours of scientific research would suggest otherwise. Even light exposure to pornography can cause both men and women to become less interested in their partners looks and sexual performance.
 
2. Being addicted to porn may cause erectile dysfunction
 
Erectile dysfunction was nearly unheard of in men under 35 before the days of internet porn. Now, with the easy accessibility of internet porn, men may experience erectile dysfunction in their teens, twenties, and beyond. Studies have shown that this is caused by a combination of lowered pleasure chemicals in the brain as well as the users propensity to consume porn alone, in front of a screen, which makes it difficult to be aroused by a real life partner.
 
3. Porn is highly addictive
 
Just like with drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes, when someone consumes porn, their brain is flooded with a feel good chemical known as dopamine. After viewing porn consistently, a person's brain is inundated with dopamine, and the brain responds by shutting down dopamine receptors. With fewer receptors, the brain cannot respond to dopamine in the same way.
 
4. Porn fuels sex trafficking
 
There are plenty of young women who enter the porn industry by their own free will, but many of the performers in porn are victims of human trafficking, ofter recruited by the use of violence or threats
 
5. Porn addiction negatively affects your relationships
 
The more porn a person consumes, the more likely they are to associate pleasure with a fake fantasy. This makes it harder to become aroused by a real person, or be interested in a relationship. This causes porn users to become alienated from their partners, and puts people at risk for psychological problems.
 
6. Porn addiction destroys your body image
 
Because of the fact that most performers in porn are touched up with makeup, cosmetic surgery, or photoshop, porn users are regularly exposed to unrealistic expectations of the human body. This causes porn users to become more likely to feel badly about the way that they look.
 
7. Porn addiction can cause psychological problems
 
Porn is often watched by a user in secret, which can leave users feeling shameful, insecure, and lonely.


....Download Porn Addiction Calendar for FREE to quit being addicted to porn!"

"SmokeQuitter was designed and coded by an ex-smoker looking to help others escape the addictive nature of cigarettes. There are thousands of ""quit smoking"" apps out there, but none have the love and time invested as this app.

• No-nonsense: It doesn't want to annoy you with notifications every 5 minutes likes other apps do. It doesn't want you to log in to your social media. It doesn't want to know your location. It only wants you to quit!

• Time-tracking: The app tracks your time free of smoke by the second, giving you detailed info of the chemicals you've avoided by quitting, as well as the money saved. Save money AND your health. Heck yes.

• Lets you smoke (sometimes): The app allows you to smoke if you REALLY need to. You can smoke up to 5.5 cigarettes per day. The app will use video ads to deter you from doing so.

• Health-tracking: It shows your health benefits according to when you last smoked. Ever wondered how much Acetaldehyde you've avoided since you last smoked? Check! Isoprene? Check! Tar? Check! In addition, the apps shows you the peer-reviewed papers it bases its calculations on (e.g. Cancer risk, insulin resistance, inflammation markers, etc).

• Money-tracking: Tracks the millions* you'll save by quitting. You can show your wife/husband that you've saved enough for that huge TV you've been thinking of getting without* getting yelled at. All thanks to SmokeQuitter.

• Lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cavity cancer, insulin resistance, carbon monoxide poisoning, inflammation markers... it tracks it all.

• Tips: SmokeQuitter gives you craving ""tips"" as well as allowing you to smoke if things get too ugly (it tracks this too!). It promotes the usage of validated smoking-cessation techniques/products to help improve your chances of quitting (This App does NOT replace a medically assisted cessation therapy monitored by a specialist).

• Friends: SmokeQuitter allows you to keep track of friends that are also trying to quit. Just scan their QR code from their SmokeQuitter App and BAM. No social media involved. No ""please log-in to continue"".

What Is the Theory Behind Acupressure?
Acupressure is just one of a number of Asian bodywork therapies (ABT) with roots in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Examples of other Asian bodywork therapies are medical qigong and Tuina. Shiatsu is a Japanese form of acupressure.

Traditional Chinese medical theory describes special acupoints, or acupressure points, that lie along meridians, or channels, in your body. These are the same energy meridians and acupoints as those targeted with acupuncture. It is believed that through these invisible channels flows vital energy -- or a life force called qi (ch'i). It is also believed that these 12 major meridians connect specific organs or networks of organs, organizing a system of communication throughout your body. The meridians begin at your fingertips, connect to your brain, and then connect to an organ associated with a certain meridian.

"Whether you want to improve your brain health and performance, or just to have a fun and maintain cognitive functions, this app is for you! ‘Brain Trainer: Tune Up Your Left and Right Brain’ is one of the best brain training apps for iPhone / iPad / iPod touch. For all ages, and it is FREE!

Unlike many other brain training apps, this app is founded on solid scientific ground. 

Did you know that the brain can be strengthened just like a muscle? Muscles become stronger with use, and using the brain makes it stronger too. 

‘Brain Trainer’ is based on famous “Stroop effect” named after J. Ridley Stroop who discovered the strange phenomenon in the 1930s. He found that when the name of a color (e.g., ""blue,"" ""green,"" or ""red"") is printed in a color not denoted by the name (e.g., the word ""red"" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the color of the words) your brain receives causes a problem. That information comes simultaneously from different brain areas / brain hemispheres. It was later found that the task of selecting an appropriate response actively involves anterior cingulate cortex.

The app has lots of mini-games that help stimulate and develop anterior cingulate cortex that is responsible for working memory, error detection, conflict monitoring, motivation, attention, modulation of emotional responses and many other cognitive functions.

Features:
- 12 games
- detailed instructions
- progress report (best / last score)
- performance report (average response time, number of correct/incorrect answers, success rate, medal, etc.)
- sound / music control

Practice daily, try to get higher scores, help your brain to be in good shape!"

"To get a body you love and keep it, you need to do a squat challenge that challenges you in the right way, and allows you to keep improving beyond 30 days.

We've put together the best squat challenges, featuring multiple squat exercises that tighten and tone. There's a reason everyone is still so crazy about squats: They're awesome for your glutes, thighs, and core, meaning you're burning caloriess and building muscles in one fantastic move.

A month might seem like a long time, or it might seem like no time at all.
However long it is, it's enough time to begin, do, and finish the 30 day squat challenge. Burn your thighs and crack on.

With the workout program challenge, you can see fantastic results in just four weeks. 

Shape a tighter booty and leaner legs at home in just 1 month.
Take up our 30 to 100(!) Day Squat Challenges and tone up and boost your leg and butt muscles and body strength to the max and get into the perfect summer shape that you’ve been dreaming of for so long.

In general, 30-day challenges are a great way to work on your fitness, because they give you an achievable (short-term) goal to keep you focused. The motivation to lose weight or get fitter is obviously great, but without something clear and defined to work towards, it’s all too easy to skip a session or two then slide back into inactivity.

And of all the 30-day challenges you might try, a squat challenge is one of the best. That’s because the unweighted squat is a strong contender for the finest bodyweight exercise in town. It works almost every muscle in your lower body, hitting big muscle groups like the quads, hamstrings and glutes especially hard.

In strength training and fitness, the squat is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, quadriceps femoris muscle (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris), hamstrings, as well as strengthening the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the legs as well as developing core strength. 

This squat challenge isn’t about accumulating reps or finding a one-rep max, though you will see an improvement in these areas. It’s about improving your overall squatting mechanics, which will allow you to lift more weight more efficiently and earn faster gains.

Wanna look rockin’ from behind? Drop it like a squat! Squats are one of the best exercises you can do for your derriere. So if you want a better booty, why not start with out 30-day squat challenge?"

While, a person with a very high BMI (e.g., 35 kg/m2) is very likely to have high body fat, a relatively high BMI can be the results of either high body fat or high lean body mass (muscle and bone).

"Are you the type of person that hates to go to the gym? Get ready to hit the dance floor! Shake up your fitness routine with a dance workout. Dancing can be an intense workout that burns major calories and builds muscles. These workouts make exercising more fun, less painful. You'll be sweating away to your very own dance party, whether you choose a 30-minute jam sesh or a three-minute quickie. And we're not talking about only low intensity workouts, this is heart pounding, calorie torching.

Dancing is a whole body workout that's actually fun. It's good for your heart, it makes you stronger, and it can help with balance and coordination. One thing that jogging doesn’t do is to help your muscles become more flexible. Dancing, on the other hand, stretches your body in new ways that you’ve never tried before. Improved flexibility is great for your body’s physical health, because it reduces your chances of injury in a fall or sprain, and speeds up the time it takes your muscles to heal after a workout.

There is an unending supply of dance moves. You can try formal dance moves, such as the steps of ballroom dances, barre or ballet. If you are more interested in trying out more modern-style dances, you can expand upon zumba, hip hop or jazz dance moves. You can event try some of the new Belly dance, Salsa or Pole Dance move.

"The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.

With the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.

The birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.

It is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.

Use the features of the Breastfeeding application.

Breastfeeding and pumping:
- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;
- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;
- record the duration of feeding/pumping;
- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;
- brief feedings/pumpings, or those that occur within a short period of time, are grouped into one feeding/pumping event
- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with current time
- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop

Liquids:
- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);
 -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;
- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);

Feeding (solid food):
- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);
- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers
- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);

Sleep:
- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;
- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines

Diapers: 
- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.

Measurements: 
- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;

Other features:
- edit or delete events as needed;
- set reminders for various events; 
- use the application in your native language;
- select your preferred units of measurement;
- view statistics;

"This is a guided meditation app powered by mantras and mudras(hand yoga) that is based on ancient Vedic knowledge and wisdom. The app offers you unique 48+ mantas, mudras and meditation techniques for dealing with 48+ types of diseases including chronic and terminal illnesses.

Compiled by our ancient seers and sages, thousands of years ago, these mantras are powerful sound vibrations that are capable of stimulating certain glands, nerves, energy centres and altering vibrations in every molecule and cell of your body. Each sound has a distinct vibration and energy and hence each mantra has a different effect. As a result a person with any health problem experiences a profound healing effect.  

Mudra vigyan or science of yoga mudras involves simple hand positions or gestures to energise different parts of the body and help to allow flow of prana throughout the system. According to Ayurveda, diseases are caused by lack or excess of any of the five elements – air, fire, water, earth and ether that causes imbalance in the body. The use of mudras directs the flow of energy in a way that balances the five elements and thus facilitates healing.
 
It is said that   a positive state of mind has a positive impact on your body. The root of an illness is in the mind.  Meditation is a powerful tool that helps in clearing your mind from negativity, anxiety, worry and other conflicts. When your mind is totally calm, alert and contented, it drives your body to perform better.  Which is why, in meditation healing happens. Meditation prevents stresses from entering your body system. When you meditate, you can silently use mantras to stay connected to the breath and the practice.

"Night Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine night shade is an optimal night filter created to provide warmlight night screen in order to ensure eye care against light blue wavelength from screen light and give you pleasant night reading while curing sleeplessness after twilight with night mode. Use night light anti glare to relieve eye strain and protect eyes from bluelight flux that can disrupt circadian rhythm, cause insomnia and restlessness, chronic migraine, sleepless chronic headache, glaucoma and cataract.

❓ What is blue light?

It's part of a natural light spectrum, which disturbs the circadian rhythm and causes sleeplessness, headache and bad eye health. Unlike red light night shade, screen light bluelight blocks the secretion of melatonin, sleep hormone, and causes restlessness. Retinal neurons are in danger if night filter anti glare is not used after twilight for eye care.

😕 The negative effects of blue light flux are:

• Eye strain, tired eyes and bad eye health
• Higher risk of glaucoma, and cataract
• Phase shifting of the circadian rhythm, restlessness, and suppression of melatonin
• Chronic migraine pain and activation of the trigeminal nerve
• Chronic headache
• Insomnia, sleepless night time and sleeplessness

Night Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine as your anti glare night screen and warmlight night mode helps you by relieving eye strain and chronic headache during night reading. Its red light night shade is best for eye care against light blue rays from
screen light that cause glaucoma, melatonin deficiency, and sleepless night time - insomnia. Cataract often develops slowly, so start your tired eyes care and improve eye health with bluelight filter by using it as a twilight night light as soon as possible!


Night Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine includes:

📱 Premade blue light filters - Use one of 5 anti glare bluelight flux filters to activate night mode and warmlight (red light) for eye care against natural light blue rays. Relieve eye strain, macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataract with night filter during sleepless night reading.

💾 Saving and editing night mode filters - Create and edit a night shift filter to rest your tired eyes from screen light or make a set of night filters to protect eyes, fix circadian rhythm, sleeplessness, insomnia and lack of melatonin after twilight.

🌚 Dimming below system minimum - Use ""Dim"" night screen option to protect eyes from natural light blue rays. It's best for good eye health and chronic headache relief during night reading because it gives a night shade warmlight in form of a night light.

🌡 Temperature customization - Use ""Temperature"" palette to set a warmlight (night mode) or cooler tint to your blue light filter. Twilight looking red light colors are recommended as a bluelight flux filter for tired eyes and used as a night shift for eye strain, chronic migraine relief, and sleepless restlessness.

🌈 Color customization - Use ""Color"" palette to adjust the color tint, intensity and dim for your night screen. Night filter provides eye care and relief from migraine pain caused by screen light.

📊 RGB customization - Use ""RGB"" to fine-tune your natural light night reading filter. ""R"" - red light, ""G"" - green, ""B"" - light blue. Night light rests tired eyes with night shade and increase melatonin and prevent glaucoma.

⏰ Automatic filter schedule - Choose the times in which the anti glare night mode will shift on and off to improve eye health. Ensure that blue light filter is always turned on after twilight to prevent cataract and fight insomnia and restlessness.

🔋 Reduce power usage - Bluelight flux night shift reduces the night screen power usage. Use natural light filters to reduce night light power usage while relieving chronic headache and repairing circadian rhythm curing your sleeplessness."

The interplay of exercise and music have been long-discussed, crossing the disciplines of biomechanics, neurology, physiology, and sport psychology. People ""automatically feel the beat"" of the music they listen to and instinctively adjust their walking pace and heart rate to the tempo of the music

Fitness instructors rely heavily on the use of music during their class as a way of motivating their clients. In addition to making physical activity and exercise more enjoyable, athletes have used music as an ergogenic aid. Most of the studies that have explored the effects of music on performance was aerobic performance.

Motivational music is described as music with strong rhythms and are fast tempo (>120 bpm)."

"Waist soreness can occur at the table-top affairs, wrong movements, loosening of the waist or back muscles. If necessary measures are not taken against lumbar aches and if they do not care, they may recur at a much higher level after a while. For this reason we should take back pain seriously, strengthen our back muscles and exercise and sports against back pain. Our ""slipped disc exercise"" practice visually includes exercises that you can do entirely at home and work without the need for any equipment. I hope you feel quite comfortable against your aches and pains.
1st Cobra Movement
First we start with the cobra exercise. It strengthens the back muscles and gives flexibility to the vertebrae. It will be great. You will feel relieved without doing it.
   Lie on your face and place your palms next to your shoulders.
    Just get support from your palms, squeeze your hips and lift your chest up with the strength of your waist.
    Keep this position for 1-2 seconds and slowly go down again.
    Be careful not to force your waist down slowly. We breathe while we get up and breathe when we go down again.
    Movement can be repeated 5-8 times.
2. Cat Camel Exercise
You know cat camel movement from the battery. The waist, neck and spine are very useful in terms of health. Personally, it is one of the exercises that you will like very much for your waist sores after a long period of desk work.
    Place your knees and palms at the beginning and take the starting position.
    Push your waist up and pull your hips in as you release your boyfriend down and take your humpback.
    Breathing, push your chin out while you lift your neck up and pull your waist inside.
    Repeat the movement 5-8 times.
3. Baby Stance Motion
You know this stance that babies often do. This exercise is a very useful exercise for your back, spine, back and abdomen. When doing this exercise, it is absolutely necessary to have a soft body, such as an exercise mattress or towel, underneath your spine to avoid getting hurt. It is effective for back and back pain.
    Lay your back on your back, pull your knees toward your chest and catch your feet with your hands.
    You stretch your waist slowly.
    Then move slightly left and right on the spinal column. This movement must be light.
    After about 40-60 seconds, stop at this position and finish.

4. Plank Exercise
Because Plank movement affects many muscle groups, it is possible to see it in numerous exercise programs. Especially the development of abdominal muscles means a tight and strong muscle group around the waist. Plank movement develops abdominal muscles while secondary and back muscles are used. It is an effective move to increase spine health and prevent back pain.
You can stretch your palms and your toes in place, with your back and hip parallel to each other, as if you are pushing.
    Keep this position for 30 seconds. You can rest for 20-30 seconds and repeat it one more time.
    As time grows stronger, you can stand in plank for 60 seconds without distortion.

Developing back muscles affects your lumbar health positively. The strong muscles surrounding the spine prevent this type of back pain. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you associate the images in our ""slipped disc exercise"" with the application description and do it at home. Now download our ""slipped disc exercise"" application and take out the pleasure.

• You can save all the pictures in the application to the memory card of your tablet or phone.
• Share all your pictures with friends and friends using in-app features, and get their ideas.
• In addition, the application and everything in its content are presented to you free of charge.

*** Important Note: Waist pain is very serious and in some cases only recommended exercises with doctor advice should be done. If you have low back pain and severe hernia, you should consult your doctor first to make it worse when seeking treatment for low back pain .. ***"

"Gluten is a family of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. Glutenin and gliadin are the two primary proteins found in these grains and they play a role in giving gluten-containing foods like dough its elasticity and bread its spongy texture. An ingredient that has been derived from a gluten-containing grain can be labeled as ""gluten-free"".

A gluten-free diet is the only treatment for the condition. Gluten is found in grains wheat, barley, and rye. On the gluten-free diet, you can eat many foods including meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, rice, and potatoes. You can also eat gluten-free substitute foods and processed foods that don't contain gluten.

A healthy gluten-free diet is no different from an otherwise healthy diet except for the fact that it doesn’t contain gluten. You should still aim to consume a balance of lean protein, healthy fats, fresh fruits, and nutritious veggies but you’ll need to be careful about which grains you consume. You can still enjoy corn, rice, quinoa, buckwheat, arrowroot, and other ancient grains as well as flours made from nuts and seeds like almond flour and coconut flour. So a gluten-free diet is simply a diet made up of gluten-free foods.

"The Anti Mosquito application works by generating Ultrasonic waves (out of audible range) that most mosquitos find repugnant. This will prevent you from getting bitten by mosquitos and other insects. The pitch of the sound is so high that most humans will not hear anything.

Only female mosquitoes bite humans and animals. They are attracted by light, body odor, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and heat.

Turn on the application and keep it close to you it will produce high frequency sound and mosquitos will avert you. It is not 100% guaranteed but will repel most of mosquitos biting you. Its not foolproof because there are about 3500 admitted mosquito species in the world and they all react marginally different to the repeller.

Use the frequency controls to find the excellent frequency for your place and enjoy outdoors without pesky bugs like mosquitos to annoy you!"

"Height is an essential factor that determines the overall personality of an individual. Though being short does not in any way undermine an individual’s capabilities, it’s a fact that tall people often become the center of attention. Some short statured people not only suffer from a lack of confidence but also face certain difficulties in some aspects of their lives.

So, is increasing one’s height naturally really possible? If yes, how? That is what we are going to see in this post. Keep reading!

7.Develop A Strong Immune System
8.Build Your Confidence

**Nutrition**

Natural methods of increasing height are all based on sound scientific reasoning and they do work if we follow them. These methods do not claim to give drastic results because these don’t interfere with our endocrine system and functioning of our body. These are the best ways to try increasing your height.

Proper Diet and Nutrition:

-Liver
-Green vegetables
-Potatoes
-Nuts such as almonds and peanuts
-Chicken
-Beans
-Peas
-Fruits like apples and bananas
-Milk and dairy products
 

Proper diet and nutrition play an extremely important role in improving our height. A well-balanced diet which is rich in calcium, phosphorus, iodine and magnesium is extremely important for proper growth. For these minerals to be assimilated into our body we must refrain from junk food and food that contains trans-fats as these interfere with the absorption of the minerals and nutrients which are needed for our growth.  In order to get protein, carbohydrates, amino acids and calcium required for healthy growth and development, we should make these following items a part of our everyday meal.

-Egg yolk
-Beef
-Carrots
-Fish
 
The importance of calcium in the overall development of the human body cannot be ignored. This nutrient is vital for the growth and maintenance of strong bones and cartilages. Thus, it is advisable to have milk and dairy products to fulfill our calcium requirements. Apart from this, we must also drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water daily to detoxify your body.

"Do The 30 Day Plank Challenge
Plank exercises are some of the overall best exercises you can do to strengthen your entire core. And keep in mind, your core includes a whole lot more than just your abs. 

How to tone you up your body in just a month? Planking is a full-body workout and you can transform your body in less than 5 minutes a day just by planking.

Perfect your plank (or learn to hold one for the first time) to tone your middle and boost your balance and posture in just 30 days.

A strong core is the foundation of a strong body. Think about it: A tree would fall if its trunk weren't solid and stable. Doing core work isn't just about your middle, either; having a strong core will make you a better runner, surfer, or yogi (or whatever activity you like to do) while improving your posture and balance. Working your core can also protect you from low-back pain — and yes, it’ll tone your abs, too.

One of the best core ab exercises out there is the plank. Not only will planking work wonders for your abs, glutes and hamstrings, you'll also find that it sharpens up your mental endurance too. The challenge pushes you to hold your plank a bit longer every few days as the month progresses. By the end of the month, the goal is to hold a 5-minute plank. Planks are not only a great exercise for your core, but the benefits of planking include a stronger back, and better balance and posture.

We created an easy-to-follow 30-day plank challenge that will get you the benefits of a strong ab core in no time. Your goal will be to maintain proper form the entire time you are holding up your own body weight. This means you will keep your whole body in a straight line, from your heels to your hips to your shoulders.

The Plank Challenge is suitable for both men and women of any ages. No equipment or special type of machinery needed, just your body.

The Plank is a form of bodyweight workout that will never go away, because it's so powerful and requires a small amount of time on your part. Plank helps you to achieve substantial results in a very short span of time. In our case, just 1 month of training.

Most times the simplest exercise move results in the greatest gains for your fitness demands and plank falls into that category. Plank is good for sculpting your core, but not only that, it works your butt and hamstrings as well.

This 30 day plank challenge is perfect for those of you who want to get a smaller waist and sexy flat tummy.

Features:
- Records training progress automatically
- A total of 5 challenges
- Create your own challenge
- Increases exercise intensity & difficulty step by step
- Keep track of your best attempts for each planking exercise
- Multiple workout plans suitable for beginners and intermediate

Surpass your fitness goals by following this 30-day plank challenge that'll transform your body.

"Welcome to the best anti mosquito repeller application on the market. 

With this one application, you can deter and repel any and all mosquitoes that come within harms reach of your tender skin! 
The app works by emitting ultrasonic, high frequency noises, undetectable by the human ear, which get into the heads of those pesky SOBs and drive them nuts!  Scientific research has shown that mosquitoes CAN’T STAND certain sound wave frequencies and we have captured those frequencies and are passing them on to you so that you may live forever mosquito free! You can play with the different settings of sounds to create a favorite sound and you can also mix and blend repellent sounds to create your own, unique super repellent. You can also user the timer function to tell your app exactly how long you need it to run!

We advise you to keep the volume of your device as high as possible and to play with the frequencies in order to find the perfect sound combination and get maximum repelling bang for your buck!

The app is not 100% guaranteed to work on ALL mosquitoes but it will definitely work on most of them!

The sounds emitted by the repellent cause no detrimental effect to humans as the human ear cannot pick up any sound wave over 20KHZ.

Say goodbye to those pesky mosquitoes and may you never itch another mosquito bite again!

(This app does not actually repel mosquitoes or any other animals for that matter, it is a repellent simulator intended for use as a prank or joke and it will DEFINITELY provide hours of fun with those friends of your who aren't tech savvy!)           
No product is 100% effective, so follow these tips to keep mosquitoes at bay:
Make sure you have screens on all your windows, get a nice big mosquito net to put around your bed. 

Some kinds of mosquitoes are drawn to light, so turn off all unnecessary sources of lights, unless of course you use anti-mosquito candles or incense. 

If you go outside in mosquito ridden areas, wear long pants and shirts, preferably made from a tight knit fabric.

Mosquitoes breed and live in bushes and shrubs as well as near open water like ponds or lakes so if you are planning on heading to such an area, make sure you follow the rules above, and bring your mosquito repellent!"

• The body fat percentage of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat.

"You were waiting and finally you get it! Your personal coach to form the perfect legs, buttocks and thighs now available on your phone and tablet. 
Lots of women would like to have firm and slim legs, thighs, and buttocks, but they avoid leg exercise because they don't want their leg size to get bigger; they are also afraid of having bigger muscle mass. It is true that there are many leg exercises that result in bigger muscle mass, but there are other exercises that will simply improve your figure and firm the body. 

 These exercises help to burn fat and create firm legs. 

When you train your legs, you improve the quantity of muscle fiber , which burns calories naturally without exercise. Besides, the more muscles you have, the more energy is needed to maintain them, so your body has to burn more calories. Leg muscles, especially the thigh muscles, are very big muscle groups. When you train such big muscles, you cause metabolic changes - you burn many more calories because you are using big muscles.

Women don't develop muscles as easily as men do because they don't have enough testosterone to do so. That is why there is no need to worry about leg size getting bigger - it really pays to train your legs.

Especially for women, we have compiled a list of exercises for the legs, thighs, and bottoms.
Functions:
- Ready set of exercises for training
- Ability to generate a set of exercises
- Animation of exercises
- Timer
- Ability to set the workout time and the number of approaches
- Calculation of burned calories 
- Track your body parameters
- Daily statistics of workouts (line graph with parameters)

"This is a simple application to help adults 20 years+ calculate their BMI based on weight and height. You can then log your BMI and track it over time, viewing your progress graphically and/or exporting the data to a CSV or HTML file.

Highlights 

• Simple and intuitive user interface. 
• Log BMI over time.
• View your BMI graphically.
• Export data as a CSV file or HTML.
• Supports landscape and portrait mode.
• BMI scale is for adults 20 years and older.

Mathematically BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat and is often times used as an estimate for overall body fatness. BMI only uses weight and height, and then compares it to an average scale. An athlete would operate outside the standard curve, since muscle mass would give them additional weight without adding body fat. This app uses a single scale for both Men and Women. To determine if your BMI is a health risk, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments."

Medical research has shown that to stay healthy and prevent heart disease and diabetes it is crucial to stand up and walk several times throughout the day. People who spend lots of time standing up and moving around, for example by taking taking quite short walks throughout the day, indoors or outdoors, are healthier and live longer. Several studies have shown that you can reduce your risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes by staying active.

WalkLogger is a pedometer that does not record or log your location. Your exercise data and any other personal information that you store in the app will not be shared with anyone unless you explicitly choose to share it. Your email address will not be shared with third parties.

WalkLogger uses your phone's accelerometer to measure your activity. Unfortunately, some phones turn off their accelerometer when the screen turns off which makes it impossible to run a pedometer on those phones without draining the battery. WalkLogger will not work properly on those phones.

"With this app you can easily generate pure waves that will stimulate your concentration, meditation or relaxation. 


Very Important 
 • Use headphones for a better sound experience 

• Don't use this app while driving or operating heavy machinery.

• Take care of your hearing, is not necessary to hear these sounds at high volume.


You can generate and save your own frequencies using two independent oscillators, controlled by two horizontal bars, with fine adjust buttons or directly by input the desired value you want (tap the left or right frequency value to open the input dialog).
You can use values with two decimal points (eg 125.65).

The sounds are produced in real time, they are not pre-recorded sounds. This enables to play them without interruption as long you want.

How it works
Binaural beats, or binaural tones, are auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, caused by specific physical stimuli.
This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove and earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims coming from the alternative medicine community that binaural beats could help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states.

The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.

To experience the binaural beats perception, it is best to listen to this file with headphones on moderate to weak volume – the sound should be easily heard, but not loud. Note that the sound appears to pulsate only when heard through both earphones. 
For more info visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats 

Important

For best results please use headphones.
Take care of your hearing, is not necessary to hear these sounds at high volume.
The bottom slide bar controls the volume, but it is independent of your device's volume, so if there is no sound or it's too high, also set your device's volume to balance the sound. 

Also Important
Latest Android versions, are evolving to manage system recourses and automatically slow down the cpu usage for optimize resources.
The real time audio synthesis, like we use in our apps is a very sensitive process when the OS is trying to stop or decrease cpu usage for this main thread.

If you have some issue playing the audio, please follow the instructions in this link:

Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include some fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.

"Medical science believe that obese people are more likely to have cardiovascular disease. Due to obesity, our brain can also be harmed. Even many life style diseases, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. are due to obesity. Perhaps in the past few years, the number of people who considered obesity sick and wanted to get rid of it has increased rapidly.

Most people resort to diet to get rid of obesity. In particular, women start eating very little in the name of dieting. This does not remove obesity, on the contrary, their body becomes weak and due to this weakness, they often become victims of any other disease.

Today in this application we are going to give you a perfect diet chart and the right way to follow it.

"Practice clinical cardiology with these 100 different cases of situations that can help you to diagnose heart pathologies.
High recommended for medical students!
Always remember to ask a specialist."
"Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG*) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. A typical ECG tracing is a repeating cycle of three electrical entities: a P wave (atrial depolarization), a QRS complex (ventricular depolarization) and a T wave (ventricular repolarization). The ECG is traditionally interpreted methodically in order to not miss any important findings.

In normal condition a heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. Below 60 heart rate is said to be bradycardic and a rate faster than 100 beats per minute is said to be tachycardic. Many athletes can have a normal resting heart rate of less than 60 beats a minute.

The heart's electrical axis is the general direction of the ventricular depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the sagittal plane (the plane of the limb leads and augmented limb leads).

An ECG tracing is affected by patient motion. Some rhythmic motions (such as shivering or tremors) can create the illusion of cardiac dysrhythmia."

What is mental health?
Currently, the World Health Organization defines mental health as: ""A state of well-being in which the individual is aware of his own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is capable of Make a contribution to your community. ""

Love, Work and Play

And, how do you get to that state of well-being? For Sigmund Freud's well-known definition of mental health as the ability to love, to work, and to play, remains absolutely valid.

The ability to love refers to the possibility of establishing authentic and intimate relationships with other people where you can give and receive affection without excessive fear. The capacity to work refers to the possibility of feeling generative, of feeling that what one does makes sense, of having a certain pride in the tasks that one performs. The ability to play refers to the possibility of enjoying the symbolic activity, to the level that is, and to be able to enjoy with others in that type of activities.

Mental health includes our emotional, psychic, and social well-being. It affects the way we think, feel, and act when we deal with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Mental health is important in all stages of life, from childhood and adolescence to adulthood.

Mental illnesses are serious conditions that can affect your thinking, your mood and your behavior. There are many causes of mental illness. Your genes and your family history may play a role, as well as your life experiences like stress or a history of abuse. Other causes may be biological. Mental disorders are common, but treatments are available.
Mental health is, in general terms, the state of balance between a person and their socio-cultural environment that guarantees their labor, intellectual and relationship participation to achieve a well-being and quality of life. The term ""mental health"" is commonly used in a manner similar to ""health or fitness"", defining mental health as follows: ""mental health encompasses a wide range of activities directly or indirectly related to the health component. Mental well-being included in WHO's definition of health: ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not just the absence of disease or illness""

"Period Tracker for Women


Menstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue (known as menses) from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as menarche. However, periods may occasionally start as young as eight years old and still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. Menstruation stops occurring after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Periods also stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. 
Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. Common signs and symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. These may interfere with normal life, therefore qualifying as premenstrual syndrome, in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, symptoms are severe. 
A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not occurred in 90 days. Other problems with the menstrual cycle include painful periods and abnormal bleeding such as bleeding between periods or heavy bleeding. Menstruation in other animals occur in primates (apes and monkeys). 
The menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of hormones. This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation.
The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle is required for the production of oocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. The menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of estrogen. This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation.

What is HIIT? (wiki)

High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training (SIT), is a form of interval training, a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue. Though there is no universal HIIT session duration, these intense workouts typically last under 30 minutes, with times varying based on a participant's current fitness level.[1] The duration of HIIT also depends on the intensity of the session.

HIIT workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition as well as improved glucose metabolism.[2] Compared with longer sessions comprising other regimens, HIIT may not be as effective for treating hyperlipidemia and obesity, or improving muscle and bone mass.[3] However, research has shown that HIIT regimens produced significant reductions in the fat mass of the whole-body.[4] Some researchers also note that HIIT requires ""an extremely high level of subject motivation"" and question whether the general population could safely or practically tolerate the extreme nature of the exercise regimen.[5]"

"Tabata interval training is the single most effective type of high intensity interval training, it's also the most intense by far, and surprisingly it's the shortest in duration: only lasts for four minutes... but those four minutes produce remarkable effects. According to the Japanese founder, Professor Izumi Tabata, one of his four-minute sessions is equal to an hour of jogging, an hour of moderate cycling, two hours of walking, an hour of Zumba or two hours of yoga. What’s not to like?
Quite a lot, actually. The idea is to increase your heart rate to its maximum by “going completely mental” for 240 seconds. This is supposed to give you both aerobic and anaerobic benefits (both cardio and muscle workout). But we’re talking about four minutes of pain.

The full Tabata program is four minutes long. It will probably be the longest four minutes of your life.
If you are going to try it, we would recommend going light with the weights until you find your range, there’s a good chance you will underestimate this workout and be begging people around you to help you off the floor.
Tabata intervals follow this structure:
		Push hard for 20 seconds
		Rest for 10 seconds.
		Repeat this eight times.
The secret of this effective is in your sprint interval. You have to go all out, so do as many reps as you can in 20 seconds, put it down for 10, then pick it up again and go hell for another 20 seconds....

"Cell biology

The free application ""Cell biology""  is very friendly, it has a beautiful and simple interface. The best choice for a pocket dictionary that is always at hand. From which you can learn a lot of new and interesting things, for example, that:

FNDC5
Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5, the precursor of irisin, is a protein that is encoded by the FNDC5 gene. Irisin is a cleaved version of FNDC5, named after the Greek messenger goddess Iris.

Metastasis suppressor
A metastasis suppressor is a protein that acts to slow or prevent metastases from spreading in the body of an organism with cancer. Metastasis is one of the most lethal cancer processes. This process is responsible for about ninety percent of human cancer deaths. Proteins that act to slow or prevent metastases are different from those that act to suppress tumor growth. Genes for about a dozen such proteins are known in humans and other animals.

Zanamivir
Zanamivir is a medication used to treat and prevent influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses. It is a neuraminidase inhibitor and was developed by the Australian biotech firm Biota Holdings. It was licensed to Glaxo in 1990 and approved in the US in 1999, only for use as a treatment for influenza. In 2006, it was approved for prevention of influenza A and B. Zanamivir was the first neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed. It is currently marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Relenza as a powder for oral inhalation.

"It's the body part that men arguably value the most, so you owe it to your penile organ to always keep it clean, healthy and fit for purpose.

Give it the care it deserves and you may not be the only one to benefit – your partner will probably be grateful too.

Gently wash the organ with warm water each day when you're having a shower or bath. If you have a foreskin, pull it back gently and wash underneath.

If you don't wash underneath the foreskin correctly, a cheesy-looking substance called smegma may begin to gather.

Smegma is a natural lubricant that keeps the penile organ moist. It's found on the head of the penile organ and under the foreskin.

If smegma builds up in the foreskin, it can start to smell, stop you easily pulling your foreskin back, and become a breeding ground for bacteria. This can cause redness and swelling of the head of your penile organ, called balanitis.

How to Clean Your Penile Organ
Irritation, infections, and unpleasant odors are just a few of the health conditions that can occur if you fail to maintain good hygiene habits for your penile health. Cleaning your joystick can also help reduce your chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Hygiene practices will be slightly different between circumcised and uncircumcised men, but both are quite similar. Learning how to properly clean your penis can help you maintain optimal health and cleanliness. 
The foreskin is the sheath of skin that covers the head (glans). At birth, the foreskin is fully attached to the penile organ. In time, the foreskin separates and can be retracted (pulled back). This can usually be done by the age of about two. Sometimes, the foreskin separates later. Occasionally, the foreskin doesn’t separate evenly and areas remain stuck to the glans. These attachments almost always resolve by puberty. 

Penile Health Care, Interest Foreskin Phimosis Correction Care 
 Strong foreskin is too long and phimosis repair correction.
While it is more common for women to get yeast infections, it is also possible for men to contract a genital yeast infection,
usually after having unprotected affairs with a partner who is already infected. The infection usually appears on the skin outside the penile organ.
Penile yeast infections affect men who are uncircumcised more than those who are circumcised. This is because a circumcised organ exposes the glans
to air, keeping it dry and cool, while yeast requires heat and moisture to grow and survive.

Maintaining good hygiene and care of your genitals reduces the chances of developing problems like skin irritations and some common infections.
Often it is assumed that men know the steps to good care, but it never hurts to remind yourself of the best practices.
The same basic principles apply whether you have a foreskin or have been circumcised.
Safe health materials are harmless to the human body, without side effects.

"The gong bath is a very ancient form of sound therapy originated in Asia thousand years ago. In this special therapy of sound baths, a gong is played in a therapeutic way to bring healing; no water is involved, but the body is immersed in the healing frequencies of the gong vibrations. This therapy can be done as a one to one or in a group treatment, and usually it is practiced outdoors.

Unfortunately sometimes is not possible to have gong baths outside, and often we don't have real (and cumbersome) gongs at hand; this is the reason why we created the Gong Bath app. To allow you to prove all the therapeutical and comfortable experience of a sound bath at your home.

All you have to do is lie down in a comfortably way, close your eyes and relax. Choose a sequence of gongs to play, among the 15 completely free integrated inside the app. Set the insight timer (we suggest sessions of 40 minutes at least) and the starting volume, and begin with your meditation session. The volume is increasing slowly while the gong sound are reproduced, creating an amazing atmosphere. 

Discover a world of peace and self discovery, a serene space for yourself to take refuge in. Gong Bath is the app that will lull you in the most comforting of meditation sessions, thanks to which you will perfect the finest meditation techniques.

Gong Bath can be used also for your osho transcendental mindfulness meditation, for your chakra balancing or your reiki practice. You can choose from a selection of 15 beautiful gong sounds, all completely free. Moreover, you can choose to add some background music to relax you even more during this experience. There are 10 beautiful songs for you to choose from, the first one of which is free for you to enjoy (the others are included in the Premium pack):

1 – Inner Journey
2 – Healing and Wellbeing
3 – Kundalini Energy
4 – Spiritual World
5 – Calmness and Serenity
6 – Transcend
7 – Reiki Music
8 – Peaceful Experience
9 – Sun Rising
10 – New Age Harmony

Last but not least, you can make your chakras spiritual healing experience truly unique by adding natural sounds to it. We chose 6 exclusive sounds of nature, the first one of which is free for you to enjoy (the others are included in the Premium pack):

1 – Ocean Waves
2 – Om Chant
3 – Frogs Pond
4 – Rain Sound
5 – Early Morning
6 – Flowing River

We hope you can improve your moments of harmony and serenity through this app. May it help you find peace and wellbeing. For any suggestions, problems or requests, please contact us at support@rehegoo.com"

Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness

"The SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) risk estimation system estimates the 10-year risk of death due to coronary or noncoronary cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular risk).

The SCORE risk charts are easy to use because they include few parameters: age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and smoking. High cardiovascular risk is defined as a 10-year risk of 5% or higher. The guidelines of the fifth Joint Task Force of the European Societies on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention recommend use of the SCORE risk charts to calculate this risk.

The SCORE risk assessment is derived from a large dataset of prospective European studies and predicts fatal atherosclerotic CVD events over a ten year period. This risk estimation is based on the following risk factors: gender, age, smoking, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.

The threshold for high risk based on fatal cardiovascular events is defined as ""higher than 5%"", instead of the previous ""higher than 20%"" using a composite coronary endpoint.

This SCORE model has been calibrated according to each European country\'s mortality statistics. In other words, if used on the entire population aged 40-65, it will predict the exact number of fatal CVD-events that eventually will occur after 10 years.

The relative risk chart may be used to show younger people at low total risk that, relative to others in their age group, their risk may be many times higher than necessary. This may help to motivate decisions about avoidance of smoking, healthy nutrition and exercise, as well as flagging those who may become candidates for medication. This chart refers to relative risk, not percentage risk."

A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm, a lightning storm, thundershower or simply a storm, is a form of turbulent weather characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere known as thunder. The meteorologically assigned cloud type associated with the thunderstorm is the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or no precipitation at all. Those that cause hail to fall are called hailstorms. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms may rotate, known as supercells. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.

Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated—that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystem, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness, relatively suspended sensory activity, and inactivity of nearly all voluntary muscles. It is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, and is more easily reversible than being in hibernation or a coma. Sleep is a heightened anabolic state, accentuating the growth and rejuvenation of the immune, nervous, skeletal and muscular systems. It is observed in all mammals, all birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or as an end in itself."
"Need a white noise generator? Look no further. These nature sounds allow deep relaxation and peace of mind as you fall asleep to the sounds of dripping rain or bird sounds.

"Presenting Dukan Diet 2020 app! The Dukan Diet 2020 emphasize of four phases which is the Attack Phase, Cruise Phase, Consolidation Phase and Stabilization Phase. This Meal Plan diet is famous because you can eat as much as you want out of more than 100 types of food in the first phase alone! Thus, there is varieties of choices to add on your recipes. This type of diet plan is developed by Dr. Pierre Dukan. 
The main rules of this type of Dukan Diet is that all the food must be cooked without oil or fat except for spraying with Virgin Coconut oil your non-stick pan (and use less quantity!). And the best part - all protein food that is high in fat such as pork, lamb, goose and duck are off limits!
Try to avoid: sugar of course, alcohol, artificial sweeteners (also not healthy), unsweetened coffee, tea and even diet sodas.

To summarise the 4 phase of Dukan Diet:

Attack Phase! 
5 days of diet. Dieters have 72 types of high protein foods to choose from. No carbohydrates is allowed during this Dukan Diet For Beginner phase. 

Cruise phase
Pure protein is still needed during this phase but add on slowly with carbohydrates foods in the form of 32 pre-approved vegetables. Stay on this diet until you have reached your dream goal weight. 

Consolidation phase
Gradually introduce previously forbidden foods such as fruits and dairy. Finally ;)

Lastly, Dukan Diet 2020 wish you all the best in your diet journey.

The Dukan diet is based on the theory that a lot of protein can help people lose weight because:

• it is low in calories.
• it makes a person feel full.
• digesting protein uses more energy and therefore more calories.

"If you are looking for an application for your Reiki sessions or you need to play relaxing music from your device for music therapy 🧘 with our app you can use it and complement with some of our 🔔 as a meditation timer or yoga timer. If you dont have your own music don't worry, we have included some Reiki healing music by default.

If you are a little lost in this subject, we have include a brief introduction about what is Reiki, the Reiki benefits and what relationship it has with Chakras.

Reiki is a natural therapy which dates back to Japan, 1922, when it was created by the Japanese Zen Buddhist Mikao Usui. Because of the work of its teachers through the years, Reiki has been transmitted to this date.

Reiki benefits

One of the greatests benefits of Reiki is that unblocks our flow of vital energy and helps to awaken our defenses thus balancing our mind and our spirit. It is not a healing technique but a natural therapy which helps us to find balance and harmony in life 🙏.

A Reiki session lasts about 45 minutes and it really helps people, as they report experiencing feelings of relief and improvement in a multitude of pains and illnesses such as stress, anxiety, muscle pain and even chronic diseases when treated through a Reiki massage.

Reiki healing energy and the 7 Chakras

This is where the 7 main chakras that every person has in their body enter into play, they are aligned along the spinal column and it is through which our energy flows.

Each chakra is connected physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually to each of our organs and glands and that is why when one of these is blocked our immunological and emotional defenses decay and physical and mental illnesses occur 🤕.

The 7 main chakras are aligned along the backbone, these are the following:

"Fasting Tracker will guide you to a new lifestyle with healthy habits. You’ll lose weight effectively and feel more active! No diet and no yo-yo effect.

IS IT EFFECTIVE?
It’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's ""fat-burning"" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.

IS IT SAFE?
Yes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

CAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?

"Are you having trouble reading small print or do you want to magnify something? Then this Android phone app is for you. It provides magnification. It also has a flashlight and auto-focus to help you see better. And you can freeze the image to counter shaky hands or take a picture of what you see.

So there I am after a wonderful Chinese dinner, cracking open my fortune cookie. But the print is so small I can't read it. How frustrating! Especially since I've always been a bit near-sighted and never had trouble with such things before.

Sound familiar? Not to worry, it's normal. Most of us have increasing difficulty focusing our eyes for close-up vision as we get older, starting at about age 45. In fact, over 80% of us need glasses or contact lenses after after turning 50.

Sure, I bought a pair of drug store reading glasses and they work fine. But I didn't have the reading glasses with me at the Chinese restaurant. Always have my cell phone though. And my “Magnifier + Light “ app is on it, of course. So I could use it to magnify and read my fortune without much trouble.

Why don't you try out the “Magnifier + Light” app for yourself. It comes in handy for reading all sorts of small print on maps, medicine bottles and phone bills as well as those little papers inside fortune cookies. Won't even cost you anything, it's a free app."

"Cholesterol Table and Calculator is an app that lets you easily browse, search for, calculate and display the cholesterol content of different foods and meals. There is no need to register or login anywhere to use it. All user data are saved in the device. I wish you health! 

With My Cholesterol Table you can:

* care about health
* know good food
* follow low cholesterol diets
* prevent diseases
* find cholesterol content in food
* fight overweight
* have it always at hand

Know the content of cholesterol in foods, follow low cholesterol diets and lower risk of diseases.

Contrary to common belief, cholesterol itself isn't that bad. It is a fatlike substance that your body creates and also absorbs from the food you eat. In fact, your body cannot function properly without cholesterol. However, too much cholesterol creates a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, the main causes of mortality in many countries around the world. View the table of cholesterol content in foods now.

There are several factors that may cause high cholesterol levels: diets that are high in saturated or trans fats and salt, being overweight or obese, smoking, not enough physical activity, inherited (genetic) tendencies, and old age. Eating a heart-friendly diet is critical to keeping cholesterol levels under control. To assist you in your diet, this app contains a table of cholesterol content. In our other app you can find a table of the glycemic index of foods. Both apps are the good way to keep control over what you eat.

So, do you know what you eat? Find out now! Install the app and use it to take control of your health.

What wikipedia tells us about the cholesterol sources?

From a dietary perspective, cholesterol is not found in significant amounts in plant sources. In addition, plant products such as flax seeds and peanuts contain cholesterol-like compounds called phytosterols, which are believed to compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines. 

Fat intake also plays a role in blood-cholesterol levels. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL (which is bad). Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications.

"Not only is this workout great for toning butt and thighs, it's also great for building endurance and burning fat. High intensity interval training (HIIT) is also the only kind of cardio training that can actually build muscle, as well. In addition to all of these perks, the exercises in this app also help build coordination, balance, and control over your own body.

We find you the best and fastest HIIT workouts to build muscle and slash fat.
When done right, HIIT is your saving cardio grace. A good HIIT workout can deliver a lot of what you want from traditional cardio — burning fat, elevating your heart rate, pushing you to sweat, and improving lung capacity. All this in a fraction of the time, making it especially useful for those of us who can't spend all day in the gym and want to workout at home. To get all these benefits, though, HIIT has to be utilized correctly, and your intensity has to be high.

Fat burning HIIT workouts are an excellent way to burn maximum amount of fat in a short period of time.The main difference between cardio and HIIT is that cardio is aerobic while HIIT is anaerobic.
HIIT can be an efficient, fun way to tackle your cardio workouts, add muscle, and shred serious fat.
You don't have to spend hours on cardio equipment to burn fat. Try one of these HIIT cardio routines for faster fat loss. HIIT Cardio Training is a form of cardiovascular exercise that has you performing high levels of intensity for short durations coupled with rest periods. 

The best cardio exercises for men and women
It doesn't matter if you're a man or a women, these are the exercises that will never get old or go obsolete. We added great workouts for women & men to look great and be healthy focuses on training for endurance. You will get you lean, toned and look good all year round.

"Movement is one of the most fundamental patterns of humankind. Health and fitness are the predominant activities associated with this movement.  Working out and eating healthy is one big favor which everybody owes to themselves. However, lack of proper guidance and accountability prevents a lot of people from getting in shape.

This application is just the beginning; we are all set to create an ecosystem where we can help each other to get better physically, mentally and socially. 

The essential components of the elements mentioned above are nutrition and workout. The thing about diet and training to be effective is that it has to tailor-made with as many as variables as possible to be useful. 

We are building an AI-based system which would take into account underlying factors like age, sex, weight to more advanced considerations like a predisposition to certain diseases and allergies to certain foods. Along with this, we are also building an intelligent training system which would be capable of recommending workouts and exercises by considering factors ranging from training experience, goals, injuries among others. This could benefit anyone ranging from a weekend warrior to an advanced athlete. This would be the first resource on our platform. 

Most of the fitness centers and gymnasiums are administered manually. We have a developed an app based CRM system which would automate all their processes ranging from managing memberships to checking on their trainers and their respective trainees.
The diet and workout resource mentioned earlier will bring additional value to the trainers of the fitness centers. This CRM system will give us access to an enormous population of fitness centers. This population would be leveraged in the form of both online and offline events to increase the engagement on our platform. 

Our company wants to promote real-world human to human interaction which is getting lost in this digital world. This is making people unhealthy both mentally and physically. We are tackling this problem heads on by our offline events. On our platform, there would be a concept of buddies. The primary criteria to be buddies would attend the same event. The events would be carried across schools, colleges, universities, societies and fitness centers in the first phase. Eventually, we would empower every user to organize their events. The businesses around the above agglomerations can be potentially used to sponsor the events. 

To augment our offline presence, we would like to introduce a concept called ""FJ Cafe."" This would be used to sell services like full body analysis, fitness consultation and products like sports supplements, healthy meals, and sports apparel.

In case you want some personalized help regarding your diet and training you can check the transformation packages.

"The OM Mantra Chanting application chants the universal mantra.

The number of repetitions is configurable by the user.

The Om Mantra or ""AUM"" is one of the most powerful mantra.

It is finite as well as infinite. It contains everything from Vedas. AUM is the representation of the Hindu trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. This single word produces the sound and vibration which allows you to feel at one with the universe. It is considered so divine in Hinduism that they place it before and after every other Mantra. 

Benefits Of The OM Mantra

Chanting of the Om Mantra purifies the environment around you and creates positive vibrations.

The Om not only benefits the person who is chanting it but also to the people around them wherever its vibrations flow.

It cleanses your aura.

It can place you in a meditational state which gives you deep relaxation.

Your concentration increases when you chant this universal hymn.

The ॐ chanting removes toxin from your body. It is said to give you better immunity and self-healing power.
It improves your concentration and helps you focus on whatever your goals may be.

The ॐ chanting actually improves your voice by giving strength to your vocal cords and the muscles around it. This is very helpful during old age.

The ॐ chanting produces a vibration and sound which is felt through your vocal cords and sinuses. The vibrations open up the sinuses to clear the airways.

The Om Mantra has cardiovascular benefits - by relaxing our mind and body, our blood pressure will decrease and our heart will beat with regular rhythm. 

Through chanting and meditation, you can have better control over your emotions, thus allowing you to see situations with a clear and rational mind. 

Regular chanting of this Mantra will take you on a spiritual journey to greater happiness and positivity, but only if it is done daily for a longer period of time. Mantras are not and overnight fix to your problems - you must have patience and learn the correct techniques.

When the OM Mantra is chanted in a group, the effects are amplified and this will produce immense positive vibrations which charge up the entire vicinity.

Some people have also claimed to lose weight through ॐ chanting as it puts your entire body in a heightened state of sensitivity - its vibrations are thought to stimulate your metabolism which would lead to weight loss.

It has been our experience that Om can even help cleanse your skin. The massive levels of internal positive energy and a cleansed aura that come from chanting the Om Mantra regularly will be reflected externally with a sunny glow on your face and body.

Your spinal cord is strengthened through the vibrations caused by sound of Aaaa. As this sound is generated from abdomen, it helps to strengthen the supporting muscles of the spinal cord.

The sound uuu is created by vocal cords which benefit the thyroid glands and the throat.

It is said that rubbing your hands together while ॐ chanting and putting those charged hands on different parts of body heals or activates those body parts.

If those energy charged hands are put on your eyes, your eye sight will start improving."

"Seriously, getting lean sexy thighs is not out of your reach. That's why this 30 day thigh slimming challenge was created. For this challenge, the workouts will be focused on losing fat and building stronger and toned thighs.

Do the 30 day challenge to achieve fat loss & lean legs.
We provide multiple workout challenges that you can do daily and a calendar will be provided so that you can follow it easily.

How to get thinner thighs in just 30 days; here are the best exercises to tone and slim down your thighs.
Our thighs are often one of the most stubborn areas to slim down and tone up. While the outer-thigh muscles tend to get worked more often from common exercises like walking or running, the inner-thigh muscles are often ignored. Increasing muscle tissue not only burns calories but also firms up that area of the body. Through Pilates exercises you will be able to further improve your thigh strength without creating bulk. That’s because Pilates, much like ballet, was designed to create long lean muscles. Pilates is also great because you don’t need any equipment or a gym to do the exercises.

While it is impossible to target weight loss to one particular body part, there are specific exercises that you can do to firm and tone legs, which ultimately leads to a smaller, slimmer lower body. Therefore, these workout programs are combinations of targeted thigh exercises and cardio. By doing this you will get far better results.

Whether you're a beginner or advanced, this slimmer thigh challenge is doable for anyone. Follow our thigh slimming workouts to get lean legs; the exercises can be done at the gym or at home.

Features:
★ Quick effective workouts; just 7 to 20 minutes per day.
★ All exercises can be performed with your own body weight.
★ The thigh slimming challenge gradually increases exercise intensity for 30 days.
★ Suitable for both beginner and pro, men and women.
★ All workouts can be done at home.
★ Records training progress automatically.

Moves to Slim Down Your Thighs
Give your legs and tush a firm push in the right direction with these effective shaping exercises. For best results, do them after a cardio session or work them into your existing strength routine three or four days per week."

"When it comes to measuring the temperature, you need to use the method that gives the most accurate result. For children under five, rectal temperature measurement will give the most accurate result. Older children can measure the temperature orally - the result will be quite accurate. Another alternative, which will give a fairly reliable result at any age, is to measure the temperature in the armpit, however, if you still want to get an accurate result, we do not recommend relying only on this method.

The latter, by the way, is preferred by many. A maximal mercury thermometer (the thermometer is properly called) costs a penny and is quite accurate, which is not the case with many electronic devices with “so-so” quality. However, it is dangerous because it is easily broken, and glass fragments and mercury couples did not make anyone any healthier. Practice shows that a poor quality electronic thermometer shows an incorrect result. In addition, a similar phenomenon is observed with a discharged battery. Therefore, it is advisable to periodically check the operation of an electronic thermometer with an ordinary mercury thermometer.

"Do you or your children have lice and do not know how to eliminate them? Discover a  quick and natural way to get rid of those annoying insects that usually appear every year at school!
The louse is a very very small parasite that lives in the hair and feeds on our blood. But do not worry, we give you options to eliminate lice with homemade and natural anti-lice remedies! They are contagious by direct contact between the heads and one of the most obvious symptoms of having them is intense itching on the scalp.Furthermore the lice lay eggs, the called ""nits"" that in about 9 days become lice, so it is very important to eliminate them before they put too many eggs.

In our app you can discover the best natural remedies for lice such as:

> Lavender essential oil: it is placed directly on the scalp and left on overnight.
> Infusion of eucalyptus, lavender or mint: 500ml of water are boiled and 30gr of one of these plants are added. When the water cools, this infusion is applied to the scalp and covered with a shower cap for one hour. After the hair is washed normally and the comb is passed to eliminate the lice called nit.
> White vinegar: It is applied all over the scalp and covered with a shower cap or plastic wrap. We leave it for three hours and then wash our hair normally. Finally a lice comb is passed.
> Garlic: Prepare a paste by crushing 8 cloves of garlic and 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Impregnate all the hair and cover it with a shower cap. Leave it on for an hour and then wash the hair normally. Pass a lice comb with damp hair.
> Olive oil: Impregnates all the scalp and cover it with plastic wrap throughout the night. Then, wash the hair normally and pass a lice comb.
> Alcohol: You can put a few drops of lemon or orange alcohol in the hair to repel the lice.
> Mayonnaise and vinegar: this combination is very effective to eliminate lice and will also shine your hair.

It is very important to disinfect the towels, the combs, the pillowcases. . . and everything you used to disinfect lice. A few drops of lavender essential oil on the neck of the shirts of the little ones will also help you to chase away those annoying little bugs!

Sexual dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have erection issues to some degree.
The following questions about ED and they include the following


The main cause of the dysfunction in young men is an addiction to pornography. 
Due to the easy access to porn, many men can view it whenever they desire. This constant viewing causes a surge in the chemical dopamine in your brain. 
Repeated dopamine surges due to porn mean the brain comes desensitized to it, therefore more is needed to feel the same effect.

What this means is that you become unexcited by ordinary sex, therefore more explicit sex is required to get you aroused.
Other causes of erection issues can be a result of stress, Heart disease, clogged blood vessels (atherosclerosis), High cholesterol

Have You ever wanted to burn body fat and get perfect abs?
Try interval workout to burn belly fat and then Caynax Aerobic Weider Six (A6W) app to form perfect 6 pack.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training, is an enhanced form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating periods of short intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 9–20 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition, improved glucose metabolism, and improved fat burning.

HIIT session consists of a warm up period of exercise, followed by six to ten repetitions of high intensity exercise, separated by medium intensity exercise, and ending with a period of cool down exercise. The high intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise. The goal is to do at least six cycles, and to have the entire HIIT session last at least fifteen minutes and not more than twenty.

There is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on your level cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking.
The original protocol set a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30–40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15–20 seconds of jogging or walking.

HIIT is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited on time.

What is the Ketogenic Diet? 
The Ketogenic diet is a fast-growing low carbohydrate, high fat (lchf) diet similar to the Paleo diet, Atkins or any other meal plan that aims to limit carb intake. The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a keto diet plan is the amount of carbohydrates and proteins allowed on a daily basis. Keep in mind, the Keto diet is not a 'fad' and has been medically researched for hundreds of years.It is one of the only LCHF diets that has significant scientific evidence backing it.

Why Keto? 
Compared to the western diet which consists largely of highly-refined carbohydrates, Ketosis, the utilization of fat ketones instead of glucose, can offer a lot of health advantages. Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight fast and consistently. However, scientific research suggests that ketosis goes further than that, such as lowering your blood pressure, risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, improving skin conditions and dental health, mood stabilization, and increasing energy levels.

-The Basics: Zero to Low-Carb, High Fat, Moderate Protein – Dropping into Ketosis.
-The Benefits: Backed by scientific studies, not by fad homeopathic guru practitioners.

"The Seventh-day Adventist diet is a way of eating created and followed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

It’s characterized by wholeness and health and promotes vegetarianism and eating kosher foods, as well as avoiding meats that the Bible deems to be “unclean.”

This app tells you everything you need to know about the Seventh-day Adventist diet, including its benefits, potential downsides, foods to eat and avoid, and a sample meal plan.

Members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church have promoted variations of the Seventh-day Adventist diet since the church’s inception in 1863. They believe that their bodies are holy temples and should be fed the healthiest foods.

The dietary pattern is based on the biblical Book of Leviticus. It emphasizes whole plant foods, such as legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains, and discourages the consumption of animal products as much as possible.

There are several variations of this diet. Approximately 40% of Adventists follow a plant-based diet.

Some Adventists are vegan, excluding all animal products from their diets. Others follow vegetarian diets that include eggs, low-fat dairy, and fish. Others choose to eat certain meats and additional animal products.

The Seventh-day Adventist diet discourages using products that the Bible considers “unclean,” like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Some Adventists also avoid refined foods, sweeteners, and caffeine.

What is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting is a dieting pattern in which you restrict yourself to eat only in a scheduled eating window.
By splitting your day into a period of fasting and a period when eating is allowed, the idea is that you will naturally reduce your caloric intake on a day-to-day basis since you’re limited to eat only during small windows.
For example, using most popular method 16/8 could look like this:
8pm - 12pm Fast
12pm - 8pm Eating Window

What are the benefits?

Intermittent Fasting has been proven to:
- loose weight
- improve insulin resistance and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes
- reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in your body
- lower cholesterol
- increase lifespan 

and much more!"

"The Water Diet, sometimes known as the Cold Water Diet, is one of the latest fads that appeal to dieters who want to melt away their fat. Compared to fasting ""cleanse"" diets and those that restrict caloric intake, such as the Rice Diet, the Water Diet doesn't limit food consumption, nor does it require exercise. The appeal of the Water Diet is that dieters can purportedly eat what they want--and still lose weight.

The exact origin of the Water Diet is unknown. Some Internet resources trace the diet to an article written and published in 1997 by the Institute for Psychoactive Research in Durham, North Carolina, while Douglas Silver Porter, purportedly a ""doctor and a scientist,"" also lays claim to inventing the Water Diet.

It's not actually a diet—there are no restrictions on what you eat, the only stipulation is that water must be cold when you drink it. The body burns extra calories heating up ice-cold water to the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees. (The colder the water the more calories burned).

How the Diet Works
On the Water Diet, the dieter drinks 64 oz. of cool or cold water in eight 8-oz. servings over the course of the day, with or without meals, in addition to the dieter's normal fluid intake. The water can be tap water, bottled water or any other kind of water that is safe to drink. The available resources on the Water Diet discourages chewing on ice cubes to make up for water intake. The Water Diet does not alter the types of foods the dieter eats, nor does it limit portion size. Exercise is not a component of the Water Diet.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
The water diet is best for a short amount of time. It is safest when combined with a normal diet, and can be dangerous when combined with fasting. The water diet may not be safe for everyone. When doing a water fast, you risk symptoms of low blood sugar like dizziness and fatigue, not to mention constipation, dehydration, and an intolerance of cold temperatures. If you know you struggle with low blood sugar, the water diet may not be for you. This type of diet is a short term diet means once you lose the weight, as soon as you go off of it, the weight comes back. 


Finally we wish you a great success on your diet journey!"

- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present
- As a biofeedback-based therapeutic tool for bruxism
- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits
- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research
- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them

WHY is BruxApp needed? 
Bruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
Studies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.

✓ Track medications your cardiologist recommend and analyze their effectiveness. When you track blood pressure you can add a medication to the measurement and find out its effect. Did it help and should I take it longer, or the dosage is too high/low, or it even doesn't help at all?;
✓ Notifications system - quickly and conveniently adjusted - now you will never forget to about the cardio journal. The most important thing in heart health is the consistency, stability, and regularity of data entry.

💊 Diary of pulse rates and arterial blood pressure tracker (monitor) will be a great assistant for any person experiencing problems with heart diseases, who suffer from hypertension (increased BP) or hypertension (low BP) diseases.

Isn't it great to know?

Everyone must know. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the normal BP range is systolic 95 - 120 mmHg and diastolic 65 - 80 mmHg. But, every person has personal normal ranges. It depends on his lifestyle or health condition, for example for one person the systolic value of 130 mmHg could be normal, but for another person, this value can be extremely high. This data must be established by your health care provider. So, in the application blood pressure tracker, we use ranges system and everyone con set up if for himself. Be sure to find out your normal limits of systolic and diastolic BP.

⚠️ Important: remember that to check your BP you must have a monitor (tonometer) on hand to enter the data in the cardio journal.  The blood pressure checker app is in no way capable of independently measuring pulse or BP(like any other).

The peculiarity of quick yoga asanas is that it affects all body systems, normalizes health, creates an excellent physical shape. The principle of hatha daily basic yoga for beginners app is based on the harmonious balanced development of all the muscles of the body, creating balance, endurance with flexibility. The difference between easy yoga classes at home and cardio training is that due to special postures (asana), the body begins to work independently, engage and develop the right muscles. This happens very harmoniously. Isn't great to become healthy in such a way?

Every daily workout has an increasing level of difficulty. You starts with the easiest personal lessons and steps. Fix your results. Later the difficulty level would gradually increase. Asanas yoga flexibility training for beginners is divided into two categories: static and dynamic with video. During training smoothly replace each other. They are suitable for men, women and even seniors.

For complete beginner, it could be a surprise at a large number of poses. Do not worry that you do not know how all the poses are called. 5 min yoga routine workout is a long process.

They certainly brings benefits in the future. Day by day you have progress, the results improves. Over time, you would definitely do more complex lessons with the beginners yoga trainer at home. This would be a great cardio load too.

Test yourself. Take 30 day yoga challenge for one person - the results would definitely come!

"Figwee is a unique calorie counter built by people who use them and wanted more.

""We've been singing the praises of Figwee to our families since I found the app. There really isn't anything else like it"", Jeff Hitchcock, founder of Children with Diabetes.

WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT/BETTER/EASIER

Figwee is the only visual calorie counting solution.
The use of text to enter portions is fundamentally flawed. Humans are visual. 
We solved this by using photos of incremental food portions, meticulously weighed, to make logging food easier, quicker, and more accurate.

Our process:

Did you have 4 oz or 5 oz of french fries?
Search for fries, pick the photo of the fries you had from the results.
Slide the slider up and down until you see the amount you ate, then tap.
The correct amount of fries and their calories are now in your food diary.

TAKE OUR CHALLENGE

The app is free to download. Try it side by side with any other calorie counting app. 
Even if you decide you like your text-based solution better, you will still have a unique tool to help you get the portion correct.

WANT MORE? HERE IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

Let's talk about food databases.
The United States has the best developed nutrient database in the world.
In this database, there are roughly 8,000 base foods.
An average person eats far fewer than this, especially when watching their calories.

We think it is important to understand that there are problems with having 10 million database entries.
This large number of entries cannot be properly managed, and users are allowed to add to them.
The result is a database that is riddled with errors and cannot be trusted, especially if you are a diabetic.

Figwee controls its own database. We tell you, for each food item, where we got our information. It is either from the Manufacturer's label/website or from the USDA database.
No one else will tell you where they got their information. It's because they don't know where they got it. 

Another problem with large databases is getting 500 results for cheddar cheese.
This forces the user to do a very specific search or sift through pages of results.
This is the opposite of simplicity and we feel strongly it is the wrong approach.
The exact brand of cheddar cheese you had is not as relevant to your success as how much you had.
If you are off by as much as an ounce, you may have just blown 10% of your calories for the day!

Another problem. Having the brand doesn't always help you.
Even though you've found the brand of a sandwich, the results can be between 460-950 calories.
It also doesn't help you to scan a bar code if you didn't eat all of the food in the package.

Figwee gives you what you need to solve these problems.
We know from experience that the most important thing is getting the portion correct.

Everything you need, only what you need.

Simplicity.

WHAT YOU NEED TO GET GOING

There are three versions of Figwee:

(1) Free food diary and slide functionality. Mobile and desktop integration. The core of Figwee with ads.
(2) Same as (1) with one-time nominal fee to permanently remove ads.
(3) Full featured Calorie Counter for a monthly fee, cancel anytime, reverts to (2). No ads ever.

Here is what the fully featured app does:

· PortionRight™ slider - Use photos of food portions to enter food into your diary
· Complete calorie tracking - Foods, activities, results. Calories in, calories out.
· My Foods - Store the foods you eat commonly for quick entry

· Results tracking - Over 20 charts and graphs so you can see your progress  
· Desktop integration - There is a desktop version for your convenience
· Control your program - Use it your way. It's your tool, not ours.
· Controlled private database -  Accurate and error free"

"Herbal medicines are naturally occurring, plant-derived substances that are used to treat illnesses within local or regional healing practices. these products are complex mixtures of organic chemicals that may come from any raw or processed part of a plant.

herbal medicine has its roots in every culture around the world. there are many different systems of traditional medicine, and the philosophy and practices of each are influenced by social conditions, environment and geographic location, but these systems all agree on a holistic approach to life. well-known systems of herbal medicine like traditional chinese medicine and ayurvedic medicine believe in the central idea that there should be an emphasis on health rather than on disease. by using healing herbs, people can thrive and focus on their overall conditions, rather than on a particular ailment that typically arises from a lack of equilibrium of the mind, body and environment. 

although botanical medicine has been practiced for thousands of years, it continues to be of use in the modern, western world. the world health organization recently estimated that 80 percent of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary health care, and the worldwide annual market for these products is approaching $60 billion. people in the united states have become more interested in herbal medicine because of the rising cost of prescription medication and the returning interest in natural or organic remedies.

whole herbs contain many ingredients that are used to treat diseases and relieve symptoms. herbal medicine, also called botanical medicine, uses the plant’s seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark or flowers for medicinal purposes. the biological properties of these plants have beneficial effects. other factors are responsible for their benefits as well, such as the type of environment in which the plant grew, the way in which it was harvested and how it was processed. the plant is either sold raw or as extracts, where it’s macerated with water, alcohol or other solvents to extract some of the chemicals. the resulting products contain dozens of chemicals, including fatty acids, sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, saponins and others."

A forest, also referred to as a wood or the woods, is an area with a high density of trees. As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions, what is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different classifications according to how and of what the forest is composed. A forest is usually an area filled with trees but any tall densely packed area of vegetation may be considered a forest, even underwater vegetation such as kelp forests, or non-vegetation such as fungi, and bacteria. Tree forests cover approximately 9.4 percent of the Earth's surface, though they once covered much more. They function as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the biosphere.

A ringtone or ring tone is the sound made by a telephone to indicate an incoming call or text message. Not literally a tone nor an actual (bell-like) ring anymore, the term is most often used today to refer to customizable sounds used on mobile phones."

"Dumbbells offer excellent variety for your weight training efforts. If you can't afford an ongoing gym membership, investing in dumbbells you can use at home is a good alternative.

You can achieve an excellent workout using your dumbbells and this weight training program at home.
Add size to your arms, chest and shoulders with our amazing dumbbell workouts. This workout program only requires dumbbells and has just the right amount of volume to promote muscle growth.

These dumbbell-only workouts can be used at home or in the gym for building muscle mass. The dumbbell only home or gym full body workouts focuses on the use of heavy compound lifts, and allows you to maximize muscle gains with minimal equipment.

Our workouts can be run for an extended period of time. As long as you are experiencing strength and muscle gains, stick with this routine.

You've heard before to lift heavier weights—doing so torches body fat, burns more calories, and helps fend off osteoporosis. This total-body strength routine is designed to help you reap all of those benefits. With a free weight workout routine, there are several options that can be added to the exercise. Plus, you will be using more muscle interaction because the weights will not be supported at all by a machine. Your stabilizer muscles will be firing away, and this will not happen when you use a weight machine. Your exercise routine is severely limited.

Compound movement exercises simply mean that you are training more than one muscle group at a time. Working more muscle groups through compound movements will make your muscles grow like never before. Be ready when your sleeves get tighter for the derisive comments about how you only wear small shirts now.

More Muscle Less Fat
Here is something that you might have forgotten from your high school science class: Muscle burns calories even while resting. There is a reason that bodybuilders can take in 6,000 calories a day and still look good. Their muscle mass is acting like a furnace for the fat and extra calories in their body. They can consume all of that food every day because their muscles use it effectively and burn the rest off.

We already established that using a free weight workout routine will allow for greater compound movement exercises. This type of training will then activate more muscles groups, which will lead to an increase of lean muscle mass. Your new found muscle will be burning away those excess calories and will force you to wear a belt when wearing your old jeans because your waist size will be shrinking. This will all happen just because you switched to free weight workouts."
"Pull-ups is an upper body compound pulling exercise, the arms must carry and lift the entire weight of the body. Pull-ups will train your muscles in the back, biceps and forearms, so it will enhance your strength of arms.

"This application is intended for patients whose long-term treatment requires punctures at regular intervals. As a general rule, they are trained in the technique of self-injection in order to be able to treat themselves without the help of a health professional. A different injection site must be chosen each time, which reduces the risk of irritation or pain.

Examples of conditions concerned: multiple sclerosis, diabetes (glucose reading and insulin), cancers, asthma, renal failure, hematological diseases, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.

Injected medications can cause side effects such as erythema, pain, induration, pruritus, edema, inflammation, hypersensitivity, etc. In this case, a regular rotation of the injection sites (locations of the punctures) must be respected in order to ensure a sufficient tissue rest period for each site.

In the Sites tab, link sites (designated by the letters of the alphabet) to the front figure or the back figure, by clicking the relevant button (""Front"" or ""Back""). The selected buttons change to green color.

In the Front and Back tabs, the sites are represented graphically by semitransparent dots, each containing a letter corresponding to the site concerned. Position the dots freely on the desired locations, moving them with your finger. The application memorizes the positions in real time.

In the Tracking tab, to specify that an injection will be made in a given site, click on the ""syringe"" icon next to the site.

The age a site is the number of days since the last injection took place. It is displayed numerically on the same line as the letter designating the site, as well as in the form of a multicolored horizontal bar.

You can change the age of a site at any time by clicking on the corresponding letter.

When you exit and return to the Sites tab, they are reclassified automatically in descending order of injection. In other words, the first site displayed is the one in which the next injection is supposed to take place. However, you can choose another one if the one proposed does not suit you (residual pain, inflammation ...).

New : Set alarms (in ""Misc"" tab).

NB : Due to some possible restrictions related to battery usage, depending on the device on which the app is installed :

- Alarms might only work when the application is present among recent open applications.

- When the device has been restarted, any alarms might be deactivated. If it's the case, you just have to reopen the app in order to have any alarms reactivated."

I created this app during an ankle injury recovery. It's hard to keep training when you're hurt, but it's really important not to stop to recover faster.

You can do these exercises while sitting on a comfortable chair without armrests.

If for any reason you feel pain while doing an exercise, stop and consult your physician.

The app features short or long workouts for different levels of fitness.

Before starting any physical activity consult your doctor. Show the type of training you are going to do and ask him if it is suitable for you and your state of health.

For current students of yoga, our app can help you improve your technique without much conscious effort, so that you can focus your mind purely on breathing and technique. It is a portable, customizable tool that will take your practice of yoga to the next level.

• Waist-to-Height Ratio: is defined as the waist circumference divided by the height. It measures abdominal obesity and therefore can be used as a better indicator of health risks than Body Mass Index.

Antibiotics are produced either from a mold or a fungus or are produced synthetically.

Question: What are the various types of antibiotics and what do they do?

Common forms of antibiotics include aminoglycosides, macrolides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins.

Aminoglycosides work by interfering with the protein formation of bacteria. Aminoglycosides include gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin. Side effects can include damage to the nerves of hearing and balance, as well as kidney injury.

Macrolide antibiotics interfere with the protein formation of bacteria during multiplication. Erythromycin is a macrolide. Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort.

Penicillins (discovered by Sir Alexannder Fleming in 1928) work by damaging the cell walls of the invading bacteria as the bacteria reproduce. Penicillin G and V are widely used for streptococcal and other bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum penicillins, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin, are used on a variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. Hypersensitivity reactions, for example, a fever or a rash, are fairly common side effects of penicillin use. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) rarely occur, but can be life-threatening.

Tetracyclines, which are active against a wide range of bacteria and other organisms, are thought to prevent production of proteins in the invading bacterial cells. The tetracyclines include tetracycline and doxycycline. Side effects of therapy may include gastrointestinal irritation, sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, and liver and kidney injury. This group of drugs should not be administered during the last four to five months of pregnancy, nor should it be given to children before the age of eight years. Permanent discoloration of developing teeth may result.

Cephalosporins are relatively new antibiotics active against a wide range of bacteria. Like penicillins, they interfere with bacterial cell wall formation. A frequently used cephalosporin is cefaclor. Side effects include rashes and fever. Sometimes, persons allergic to penicillins will also be allergic to cephalosporins."

"A Doppler ultrasound is a test that uses high-frequency sound waves to measure the amount of blood flow through your arteries and veins, usually those that supply blood to your arms and legs.
Doppler Ultrasound app was designed to teach clinically relevant aspects of Doppler to sonography student, sonographers and physicians. I wanted this to stimulate the conversation in the reading room.

Doppler ultrasound
An application of diagnostic ultrasound used to detect moving blood cells or other moving structures and measure their direction and speed of movement. The Doppler effect is used to evaluate movement by measuring changes in frequency of the echoes reflected from moving structures.

In many instances, Doppler ultrasound has replaced x-ray methods such as angiography, as a method to evaluate blood vessels and blood flow. Doppler ultrasound permits real-time viewing of blood flow that cannot be obtained by other methods. Doppler ultrasound has proved a boon in all areas of ultrasound, aiding in the evaluation of the major arteries and veins of the body, the heart, and in obstetrics for fetal monitoring.

Visiting music festivals on all continents (yes, even in Antarctica). Observing work of street musicians, folk artists and greatest composers.
Year of exploration in the field of music. Countless sounds, tons of inspiration, many adventures and unforgettable memories.

"•••More than 2 hours of yoga with music, stopwatch function, pictures and descriptions of 77 postures organized in 2 programs.•••

•HOW DOES THE APP WORK ?

Thanks to its simple design navigation is very easy: you just need to launch the program of your choice and you will see a series of positions, illustrated with a picture and a description. We have even developed a stopwatch function to guide you and show you how long you should hold the positions. You can even break if you want to stay longer on a position, go back or move forward if a position seems too difficult, for example. 
Note also the small boutton Auto-Play on the top left of the screen: check it if you want the positions keep coming. We tell you which muscles each posture solicits. Please read the description of each position before doing it. Hold the position as long as you feel comfortable, if it takes too much on certain muscles stop. It is better to stay longer in a position without forcing. This is the principle of yoga : softly but deeply.

•BEGINNERS PROGRAM :
A beginner program combines restorative soft yoga postures and yin yoga for a period of 60 minutes. This program has been designed by our expert yogis. It will bring you deep relaxation, power and  a great well-being feeling. 
Perfect to practice in the evening, before to go to bed or when you are stressed. It can be good to practice this program even for expert yogis because it restores the bodies in depth and provides a complementary practice to more powerfull or cardio yoga.

•PRO PROGRAM :

If you are unable to perform the positions, try the following or find a similar variation of the position to feel more comfortable .

How does this KeenMind - guided meditation free app for sleep and relaxation work for you?

Guided meditation is simple and allows beginners to start meditation practice very simply. They don't have to worry about being wrong, they don't have a question to ask since they just have to listen to the instructions and follow them. Guided meditation offers you to apply simple principles to find out what it is to meditate. It is the verbalization of what you will have to learn to do without thinking about it, to reach a higher stage of concentration.

At first, the guided meditation is there to allow you not to think about it. Then, when you have practiced enough to do without the meditation guide, do not hesitate to practice alone. In this way, the instructions will not clutter your mind. The role of the meditation guide is therefore to be a reminder, to show you the directions where to go. So you can walk without worrying about where to go, how to get there, etc.

In practical terms, guided meditation is often in the form of an audio file or a video with a voice that gives you simple instructions. You do not need any prior knowledge in meditation to follow them since they call upon concepts known to all. From these, you will need to refine your perception and deepen your concentration. The voice simply tells you what to do, but you remain fully involved in your meditation session. If images exist, they will most often help you detach yourself from the banalest sensations. It will allow you to work more in-depth and go beyond the most obvious aspects."

""Hi! 
We are Zen Journey and for the long time we were trying to find the best relaxing music. Music that perfectly calms you down and let you forget about all your worries.
We reached the farthest corners of our planet (we even planned to go to outer space, but some wise guy told us, that there are no sounds). Everywhere we were collecting music, voices and beats. We recorded waterfalls in Africa and rainforests in South America. Listening to echo in bottomless caves of Abkhazia and opera singing in Italy. Visiting music festivals on all continents (yes, even in Antarctica). Observing work of street musicians, folk artists and greatest composers.
Year of exploration in the field of music. Countless sounds, tons of inspiration, many adventures and unforgettable memories.
With all this stuff, we locked ourselves in studio to compose, modify, remade and record new tracks.
That was really long twelve months.
But we did it.
Best relaxing music. And we give it to you.
Enjoy!""

"Stretching exercise & Flexibility training– is just the right application for any person, who cares about his health.
Nowadays people often have low activity levels and sedentary lifestyle, so to do flexibility stretches pre and post-workout is very important for anyone. All stretching exercises for beginners were selected to develop the elasticity of the body and do not require any additional equipment.

Stretches for flexibility
The daily stretch workout is suitable for all groups of people. There are 60 different routines to do flexibility training for beginners, and all of them have detailed video and text instructions. Just follow the instructions of the virtual instructor

Everyday morning warm-up
What could be better than a charge of vivacity and energy in the morning? Just do a workout and see how your health gets better and better every morning. In addition, the morning flexible workout has a great influence on mood throughout the day and overall vitality. Flexibility training for beginners, for gymnastics, for men and women has 3 different programs and over 50 different workouts during which you can do the full-body training.

Warm-up
Before performing any physical exertion, for example, when running or when visiting the gym and pool, all muscles must be prepared and heated. The warm-up will allow you to do stretches to improve leg flexibility and to prepare the muscles and avoid their overtraining, possible injury and damage. 

Muscle tension and pain relief
Muscular tension - constantly increased muscle tone when it is impossible to fully relax them. The specially designed training system will get rid of muscle cramps and blocks. What makes this happen? In carrying out the sports activity, there is an increase in the local blood flow, especially in the muscles and ligaments, due to which the local metabolism and metabolic processes are enhanced. So, if you have flexible muscles - everything will be ok. Do the upper and lower body, leg stretch, shoulder stretching exercises for beginners.

Application functionality:
✓ 60 different stretching exercises for beginners for the full body of different levels of complexity and for all muscle groups;
✓ Each stretch routine contains detailed audio, text instructions and videos of their implementation;
✓ 3 training programs are provided and prepared for stretch workout for every day, you can also create your own workouts, set the level of difficulty and length, also every program has different stretch plan and different difficulty – Basic program is the best choice for the beginners, 7 minute or 10 minute stretch exercises – is for everyday stretching workout;
✓ We've created a special motivation system that will keep track of your results and motivate to achieve more and more;
✓ You can create your own programs for leg flexibility stretches for beginners, for runners;
✓ Notifications system - Now, you will never forget to do stretch fitness;
✓ Detailed statistics – make a 30-day challenge and track your results and your progress.

We use a special system to test our elasticity. To do this, we offer to regularly measure our indicators:
1) The distance from the fingertips to the floor when tilted forward - characterizes the general condition of the spine and its health. Just do flexible stretches for men and women, even for runners and the results will come!
2) The distance from the center of the palm to the level of the knee when tilting sideways from a standing position - here is the condition and elasticity of the back and waist when tilting.
3) The distance to the floor from the position when the person sits on the splits - if the muscles of the legs are clamped and their elasticity is missing, then this is a very difficult task.

⭐ The main task of this app is not only to do body flexibility training for beginners, men & women, for gymnastics, - but to create a stable habit of regular stretch exercises in the context of life."

"What is brain waves ? 
Please refer to this excellent description below 

Please note : Below article is referenced from wellandgood web site (https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/brainwaves-biohack-sleep-health-focus)

""The 5 types of brainwaves
Now here’s where it gets fun: Brainwaves are grouped into five distinct categories, each of which is associated with a very specific type of task and mental state.

The most high-frequency—and, some may say, high-vibe—of the bunch are gamma waves. “Gamma waves are often associated with insight, peak focus, and expanded consciousness,” says Winters. “These waves are generated when the brain is learning new information, sharply concentrating, or storing memories.” She adds that this “hyper-focused, tranquil attention” is characteristic of Zen meditators and master musicians.

A step down are beta waves, which is what most of us experience most of the time in our always-on society. “Their upside is that they allow us to concentrate hard on tasks at hand—and they’re critical when we read, write, and socialize,” says Winters. (It’s the frequency of the hustle, basically.) “The downside of beta waves is that they can zap our energy and reduce emotional awareness and creativity.”

Once we get home at the end of the day, if we’re lucky, we shift into a relaxed, reflective alpha wave pattern. “If you daydream, wind down for bed, or sit down with a good book, your brain is likely in an alpha state,” says Winters. On the other hand, if your brain has trouble shifting from beta to alpha—a stress-induced phenomenon called “alpha blocking”—you could suffer from insomnia, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, says Winters.

Finally, once you fall asleep, you experience theta waves (the ones associated with dreaming) and delta waves (which promote deep, restorative, dreamless slumber.) Interestingly, theta waves are also linked with being in that elusive, hypnotic flow state associated with peak performance, as well as the autopilot mode we shift into when we’re doing something we’ve done a million times before, like driving home from work on a familiar route. “[People can] have flashes of insight or bursts of creativity when in these flow states because their behaviors are often so automatic that they can mentally disengage and just be,” explains Winters. So that explains why I have all my best ideas in the shower… """

"Lose weight, keep fit, get healthier, strengthen your body - the 5 Min Super Plank Workout Challenge is perfect for these and a lot more. Keep reading! 

A very easy to use counter for the famous Five-Minute Plank exercise. You know what is the next position and when to change it.

The Five-Minute Plank uses relative inactivity to challenge the abdominal muscles and strengthen them. In five minutes you get to exercise as many parts as possible of the muscle wall. The result: strong abs, a strong core, more power, better coordination... plus you get to look good on the beach.

What it works: Abs, chest, glutes, lower back & core

Tip: To gain the maximum out of your time in this exercise, tense your abdominal muscle group at each rep.

6 REASONS to start training:

1. Build yourself a smashing fit body - because there is no greater feeling than looking in the mirror and simply just love what you see.

2. Brag around about your toned muscles - low body fat level, noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size

3. Keep your heart strong and healthy - because your heart is a muscle also and it gets stronger and healthier if you live an active life. 

4. A clear and beautiful glowing skin - you don't have to worry anymore about celulite when you're half naked on the beach. No more dimply skin coming out of your swimsuit.

"Flexibility is the key to unleashing power and speed by increasing the range of motion active (agonist) muscles have to travel before they are held back by the opposing (antagonist) ones. Being more flexible can also reduce the chances of injury when exercising, though the biggest benefit will be in the way you walk and stand. This 30-day program will help you increase your flexibility. 

The program utilises a mixture of active (leg raises) and passive (holding the splits position) stretching techniques to give you the fastest gains possible in the shortest time.

If you have stiff hamstrings, locked-up hips, and a painful lower back; if you’ve tried yoga and stretching exercises, but didn’t see many results, then there’s a very good chance we can help you."

"What is a gallbladder ultrasound?
An ultrasound allows doctors to view images of the organs and soft tissues inside your body. Using sound waves, an ultrasound provides a real-time picture of your organs.

This better allows medical professionals to diagnose conditions and determine underlying causes of problems you may be experiencing.

While ultrasounds are most commonly associated with pregnancy, the test is also used for other purposes, including providing pictures of your abdominal area.

A gallbladder ultrasound is a noninvasive and typically painless examination used to diagnose conditions related to the gallbladder. Unlike X-ray, ultrasound does not use radiation.

Why is a gallbladder ultrasound performed? 
The gallbladder is located under the liver on the right side of the abdomen. This pear-shaped organ stores bile, which is a digestive enzyme the liver creates and uses to break down fat.

Gallbladder ultrasounds are used to diagnose a number of conditions. Your doctor may prescribe the procedure to test for gallstones, which are hardened deposits in bile that can cause nausea and abdominal pain along with back and shoulder pain.

Another condition potentially requiring a gallbladder ultrasound is cholecystitis, where the gallbladder becomes inflamed or infected. This often results from gallstones obstructing a tube that moves bile from the gallbladder.

Ultrasound - Abdomen
Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen uses sound waves to produce pictures of the structures within the upper abdomen. It is used to help diagnose pain or distention (enlargement) and evaluate the kidneys, liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, spleen and abdominal aorta. Ultrasound is safe, noninvasive and does not use ionizing radiation.

Ultrasound imaging is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions.

An abdominal ultrasound produces a picture of the organs and other structures in the upper abdomen.

A Doppler ultrasound study may be part of an abdominal ultrasound examination.

Doppler ultrasound, also called color Doppler ultrasonography, is a special ultrasound technique that allows the physician to see and evaluate blood flow through arteries and veins in the abdomen, arms, legs, neck and/or brain (in infants and children) or within various body organs such as the liver or kidneys.

What are some common uses of the procedure?
Abdominal ultrasound imaging is performed to evaluate the: kidneys liver gallbladder bile ducts pancreas spleen abdominal aorta and other blood vessels of the abdomen

Ultrasound is used to help diagnose a variety of conditions, such as:
abdominal pain or distention (enlargement)
abnormal liver function
enlarged abdominal organ
kidney stones
gallstones
an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
Additionally, ultrasound may be used to provide guidance for biopsies."

"Did you know that a correct breathing pattern is extremely important when it comes to help your body function to its fullest? Yes, without correct deep breathing exercises, you could be screwing up your mood, sleep and eating habits! Breathing techniques are more important than what you may think... This is why you need the Deep Breathing Exercises app!

Deep Breathing Exercises is the best app to learn diaphragmatic or pranayama yoga breathing. Included inside it are 4 lung exercises, each one of which with its own timer, animation, explanation and ratio: 
- Normal Breathing (inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds)
- Square Breathing (inhale/keep in/exhale/keep in again for 4 seconds each)
- Pranayama Breathing 478 (inhale for 4 seconds, keep in 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds)
- Yoga Breath (inhale for 5 seconds, keep in for 20 seconds, exhale for 10 seconds)

The benefits of each of these types of rhythmic breathing include fight social anxiety and improving sleeping patterns, blood circulation and mood. Keep in mind that you have to follow the ratio and timer correctly.

Want to create your own breathing exercises, specifying the length of time for which you will inhale and exhale? The Premium Version of Deep Breathing Exercises will let you do that!

Remember that this mode is for experts only (and you can also create exercises with the technique of “1-4-2 Ratio”); refrain from inserting ratios that could be impossible to achieve or that could damage your health.

DISCLAIMER
AlcoTrack: BAC Calculator & Alcohol Tracker is a drinking diary app to track your alcohol consumption, analyze your drinking behavior, and, ultimately, to estimate your blood alcohol content (BAC). Please note that since your BAC is depending on many individual factors, this app can only give you a rough orientation. AlcoTrack cannot replace a breathalyzer. In case of doubt, you should never drink and drive. I do not assume any liability for the correctness of the results.

"Welcome to the Check Your Hearing app for Android devices,

An application designed to measure the hearing test for pure frequencies, the application is suitable for use by all people, especially for those who suffer from hearing impairment and the elderly, now you can take a primary hearing test and monitor the hearing condition you have at home and through your mobile phone only!

Our application is based on a test called Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), which is a quick way to measure the strength of hearing in both ears. In just a few minutes, you can test your ability to distinguish different pure frequencies with a specific sound.

We recommend that you conduct a hearing test in a quiet area without interruption, and you will have to perform a hearing test using headphones, and finally we recommend that you conduct the examination for long periods and monitor the differences between the charts and refer to the doctor in case there are significant differences in some frequencies because they indicate a defect.

The test is based on finding the so-called auditory threshold, which is the lowest sound percentage that you can hear at the frequencies listed on the test page for the left ear first and then the right ear, and after the examination is complete, the audiogram will appear, which should be similar to or very close to the actual examination. According to the testimony of many commentators on the application page in the store.

The test may show poor hearing, especially at low or high frequencies, especially in the elderly, and this is very normal for anyone, which is called presbyopia, as the nerve cells in the hearing nerve also age with age, the normal hearing of a person is often very strong between the frequencies 250 to 6000, the level of speech heard by the human ear.

You should know that this test was done with the help of an audiologist and does not involve any risks and is a quick way to measure your hearing, and we do not recommend relying solely on the results of this test as a substitute for a visit to an otolaryngologist. If you think you may have impaired or lost hearing, we recommend that you consult a hearing care professional for a more comprehensive examination.

We hope you have a healthy time with our application, Check Your Hearing, and you are welcome."

"A wide sculpted chest is a man’s visiting card. Our own certified fitness and bodybuilding trainer developed this chest workout routine for men so anyone can build a strong set of pecs and increase their strength and power in 1 month without weights.

Push-ups is a backbone exercise included in probably every muscle building training program. There’s the reason: they work! Our bodyweight exercise program is based on the most effective push up variations for every part of the chest muscle.

You can exercise at home, at the gym or even outside – no additional equipment required. The routine takes around 30-40 minutes to complete. We recommend working out every other day. For the best results it’s absolutely crucial to exercise at least three times per week!

We’ve also included a weekly meal plan specifically aimed at building muscle. Eating a proper diet gives you energy for your workout and greatly increases results.

In 4 weeks your upper, middle and lower chest muscles will shape up nicely as well as your delts, triceps, abs, back and shoulder muscles. Other guaranteed bonuses include an increase in stamina, a metabolism boost and strengthening of cardio-vascular system with a healthy dose of weight loss on top.

After 4 weeks we recommend you continue exercising to maintain and reinforce the results. Should you feel the need for further chest muscle gains – use additional weight in your training. More detailed information can be found inside the app."

"Dog Whistle helps you train your dog to perform actions such as sit, stay, come, and lie down.  Dog Whistle lets you set the frequency of the whistle so that your device emits a sound that only dogs are able to hear, which allows you to train your dog without disturbing others in the area.

Dog Whistle produces sounds that cannot be heard by human ears. Loud sounds can be harmful to animals. Please test the Dog Whistle volume by setting the frequency to something that you can hear before increasing the frequency to something in the ultrasonic range. 

To begin:

1)	Start with a frequency that you can hear and configure the app volume. 
2)	Increase the frequency until you can no longer hear the sound. Children can hear higher frequencies than adults. Do not use 20,000 Hz unless you have to, because some devices will only play sounds up to 18,000 to 19,000Hz.  If your dog is not responding to the higher frequency sounds, it is possible that your device is not capable of emitting sounds at that frequency.
3)	Press and Hold the “Blow Whistle” button to generate a tone, or select one of the commands from the list.  The list includes the following commands: sit, stay, come, lie down, off, stop, leave it, and no.  Each command is a sequence of up to four short, medium, or long “whistles.”  The whistle icon indicates that pattern that is blowing so that you can transition from app to a real-world whistle.

How does dog whistle training work?
Generally, before introducing the dog whistle, your dog must already be able respond to your voice commands. 

Grab some treats and take your dog to a place with no distractions. When your dog is not paying attention to you, press the “Come” button and praise your dog when he comes to investigate by giving him a treat.  Wait until the dog is no longer paying attention, and repeat the process. Eventually, the dog will learn to come to you when you press the button.

Praise the dog with a treat every time during training. Practice only a few times per session, and change locations for each training session.

After the dog masters the ""come"" command, begin introducing other commands by verbally saying a command and then pressing the corresponding whistle command.

Dog Whistle Training Tips

Do not over work your dog. Dogs have good days and bad. Keep trying!

Commands such as Come and Sit are easier than others. Start with those first.

Always use positive reinforcement.  NEVER use the dog whistle in a negative manner. 

Be consistent. Make sure that all humans interacting with the dog train the dog the same way. 

Have fun and please be nice to your dog!

You don't need a gym membership to melt that unwanted flab and look fit. In fact, you don't even need equipment.
With minimal equipment and the convenience of home, these high-energy home workouts for women can help you get fit and lean fast. Combining cardio and strength, this full body workout burns calories fast. It can be carried out at home with no equipment. The strength exercises uses only body weight, making sure the female watchers will tone but not build their muscles.

Bodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that we use in our daily lives. Every bodyweight exercise involved utilizes multiple muscle groups, gets your heart rate pumping, and burns tons of calories. Essentially, circuit weight training, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns a lot more calories than steady cardio. When you strength train, you burn calories. Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterwards rebuilding your muscles, which in turns burns even more calories.

App features:
- 6 Workouts.
- 11 Workout Programs, varying from 2 to 12 weeks.
- Tracks your progress
- View statistics about your workouts"

And you can notice your body
From the inside
Noticing the shape of your body, the weight, touch
And let yourself relax
And become curious about your body
Seated here
The sensations of your body
The touch
The connection with the floor
The chair
Relax any areas of tightness or tension
Just breathe
Soften
And now begin to tune into your breath
In your body
Feeling the natural flow of breath
Don't need to do anything to your breath
Not long not short just natural
And notice where you feel your breath in your body
It might be in your abdomen
It may be in your chest or throat
Or in your nostrils
See if you can feel the sensations of breath
One breath at a time
When one breath ends, the next breath begins
Now as you do this you might notice that your mind might start to wander
You might start thinking about other things
If this happens this is not a problem
It's very natural
Just notice that your mind has wandered
You can say ""thinking"" or ""wandering"" in your head softly
And then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing
So we'll stay with this for some time in silence
Just a short time
Noticing our breath
From time to time getting lost in thought and returning to our breath
See if you can be really kind to yourself in the process
And once again you can notice your body, your whole body, seated here
Let yourself relax even more deeply
And then offer yourself some appreciation
For doing this practice today
Whatever that means to you
Finding a sense of ease and well being for yourself and this day

"I decided to train my breath and wanted to find a suitable application. But I couldn't. There is either just a cyclic stopwatch, or quite some ugliness. And okay, I know what to do. But how will a normal inhabitant understand how and why he needs it?
So I decided to make a similar application.
It is easy to use and interesting to learn.
Breathing gymnastics consists of simple breathing exercises. With time, the saturation of oxygen in the blood, the general endurance, and of course, the mood increases. If you are looking for breathing exercises for weight loss, you are also in the right place. Rhythmic breathing when walking and Wim Hof breathing burn calories as hell. Diction and breathing in speech improve - you may become a great orator. Calm breathing is the best cure for stress, anxiety and other nasty things.
Even if you came to us from the astral plane and crave great wisdom, come on, have a seat. All breathing practices are certified by the Tibetan sages of great yoga. With the first progress in breathing from meditation there will be no retreat, and prana will pour out so strong that you will have to hold your Kundalini snake to stay at place. 
Texts and features open gradually as you train. I hope this will help to motivate you. Everyone who knows our previous applications will be glad - here the material is also served as a game and with humor."

"Smoothies are a great tool for weight loss because you control the ingredients. They make perfect vehicles for relatively low-calorie, yet nutrient-laden ingredients that can keep you full for a long time.

By combining the right ingredients, you can create smoothies that taste great and help you drop pounds. It doesn’t take long to learn what to use and how to make the right combinations. Banana. Peanut butter. Cocoa powder. Milk. Ice cubes. Yogurt. Done. 
A perfect smoothie will not magically make you lose weight. In fact, no one thing is going to do that—at least not in a healthy or sustainable way. If you want to get in shape you must also address a range of other factors that play important roles: sleep, stress, hormones and other medical issues, to name a few. Only by looking at weight loss from a holistic point of view can you home in on a healthy goal, effect meaningful change, and see sustainable results. 

Smoothies are an essential part of any good strategy for healthy, lasting weight loss, but only when done right. Nutritionists agree that incorporating a nutrient-dense smoothie into your daily diet can help avoid pound creepage by keeping hunger levels in check and even accelerating your metabolism thanks to their filling fiber and muscle-building protein. 

Now, whether you're looking for help on your weight loss goals or just want some delectable drink inspiration, check this app out, and dust off that blender.
Just download this app and start losing!"

"IRVeinViewer allows you to improve the visibility of the veins*, using better penetration of infrared rays through the skin and hemoglobin contrast (Hb and HbO2) in the near infrared range with surrounding tissues. In addition, since melanin (skin pigment) absorption is maximal in the shortwave part of the spectrum, and in the IR region it drops significantly, skin color has little effect on the observability of the veins.

IRVeinViewer is extremely easy to use - launch the app and point your smartphone at the search area. Everything else happens automatically - turning on the backlight, highlighting the IR image and adjusting the optimal contrast.
Tap an image on the screen to adjust the focus.
Freeze a image with button Freeze/Run.
Using the IR source/2D Filter button, select to view the original infrared image or processed by the filter.
Using the Thin/Thin Max / Mid/Mid Max / Wide/Wide Max button, apply a 2D filter to increase the contrast of thin / wide veins to the Freeze Frame.

 *: It works poorly with cameras with aggressive denoiser.
The IRVeinViewer does not work at all if the veins are hidden by a layer of subcutaneous fat. Usualy, for most people up to 20 years it is insignificant, and the veins are clearly visible in the infrared range on the arms, legs, head. On the neck arteries can also be seen. At age after 40 years, visibility is keep on the biceps, fist and forearm. Fist veins are visible in almost all.
In addition, the hemoglobin level matters, the higher it is, the more contrast the image. Its level depends on gender (higher for men), fitness (endurance sports), degree of fatigue, smoking. An abstract ideal variant is a man of 20-30 years old, who was engaged in cross-country skiing, with a small smoking history. "

"Resistance bands are a great addition to any strength training routine or rehabilitation program, and they come in a variety of sizes, lengths, and resistance levels.

They’re also portable and easy to store, so they’re perfect for home use, hotel workouts, or making the most of a small space at the gym. A resistance band is one of the most inexpensive, convenient pieces of workout equipment you can own. They are remarkably easy to learn to use, and allow you to create a remarkable range of exercises using a single piece of equipment.

In the world of strength training, resistance bands tend to fly under the radar—especially when compared to heavy hitting equipment like kettlebells and barbells. But what’s not to love about resistance bands? They’re lightweight, versatile, and easy to stow in a gym bag or carry-on, making them an ideal choice for the guy who wants to be able to train anytime, anywhere. You can use them on their own, or add them to more standard exercises to vary up your resistance for a more diverse workout.

Mini resistance bands are indispensable and therefore we would like to give you the best mini resistance bands exercises to get started with. The bands can be used for both upper and lower body resistance training. They’re also perfect for stabilizing shoulder muscles and executing lateral movements and leg extensions. With mini bands, you can target muscle groups, including your core, and maximize strength-training results. You can also use the bands for stretching — it’s a win-win fitness tool.

Resistance bands give you a new way to work out and lose the weight, as well as tone up for a more defined muscular physique. They will target places on your body that can stabilize muscles that you don’t normally use."
"Cholesterol Table and Calculator is an app that lets you easily browse, search for, calculate and display the cholesterol content of different foods and meals. There is no need to register or login anywhere to use it. All user data are saved in the device. I wish you health! 

With My Cholesterol Table you can:

* care about health
* know good food
* follow low cholesterol diets
* prevent diseases
* find cholesterol content in food
* fight overweight
* have it always at hand

Know the content of cholesterol in foods, follow low cholesterol diets and lower risk of diseases.

Contrary to common belief, cholesterol itself isn't that bad. It is a fatlike substance that your body creates and also absorbs from the food you eat. In fact, your body cannot function properly without cholesterol. However, too much cholesterol creates a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, the main causes of mortality in many countries around the world. View the table of cholesterol content in foods now.

There are several factors that may cause high cholesterol levels: diets that are high in saturated or trans fats and salt, being overweight or obese, smoking, not enough physical activity, inherited (genetic) tendencies, and old age. Eating a heart-friendly diet is critical to keeping cholesterol levels under control. To assist you in your diet, this app contains a table of cholesterol content. In our other app you can find a table of the glycemic index of foods. Both apps are the good way to keep control over what you eat.

So, do you know what you eat? Find out now! Install the app and use it to take control of your health.

What wikipedia tells us about the cholesterol sources?

From a dietary perspective, cholesterol is not found in significant amounts in plant sources. In addition, plant products such as flax seeds and peanuts contain cholesterol-like compounds called phytosterols, which are believed to compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines. 

Fat intake also plays a role in blood-cholesterol levels. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL (which is bad). Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications.

The app includes optional in-app purchases like:

1) Remove ads
2) Premium features 

In the premium you get:

* Calculator of the Cholesterol Content
* Cholesterol content per serving and Meal calculator
* Weight tracking with statistics and beautiful charts
* Future additions to the app
* Import/export all your data to/from cloud storage

"Fitbit Reminder app prevents you from losing and forgetting your Fitbit.  Helps you get your Fitbit back on your wrist in seconds.

- Get your steps and win your challenges every day
- Never leave your Fitbit at home
- See your Fitbit's last location on the map
- Quick notifications if your Fitbit falls off your wrist

Your Fitbit can fall off your wrist without you knowing. Forgetting to wear your Fitbit before leaving your house or work is very common! Fitbit Reminder can help solve these problems by tracking your Fitbit's location and notifying you to wear your Fitbit in case you forgot to put it back on.

The app works with the following Fitbits - Fitbit Ace, Ace 2, Alta, Alta HR, Blaze, Charge, Charge HR, Charge 2, 3, 4, Flex 2, Inspire, Inspire HR, Ionic, Surge, Versa, Versa 2, and Versa Lite.  Does not work with Fitbit Flex, One, or Zip.  Sorry :(

WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING
-----------------------------------
""This app is a life saver. It's very easy to leave my house without my Fitbit Alta. The notifications I get right before I leave the house are the best. I hate losing Fitbit step challenges because I forget to wear my Fitbit.""

""My Fitbit has a crappy band design and it falls off way more than it should. Especially doing yard work! As soon as it disconnects, pull up the map in the app and you can see exactly where your Fitbit fell!""

""Mornings are crazy at my house and I can't count the number of times I've left for work with my Fitbit still on the nightstand. This app has already helped me out several times by reminding me that I've left it behind before I've gotten out of the driveway.""

""I love this app. I used to miss days all the time when I left my Fitbit at home by accident. Now I get all my Fitbit steps every day!""

-----------------------------------

HOW DOES IT WORK?

1. Launch the app on your iPhone and select your Fitbit

2. When the app cannot ""see"" your Fitbit it sends a notification that your Fitbit is missing

3. Use the map in the app to see the last know location of your Fitbit. Or use the notification as a reminder to put your Fitbit back on your wrist

Important:
- The app MUST run in the background. Our tests have shown that our app only uses 1% of your battery per day!!
- The app MUST be launched again if you restart your iPhone

Pretty simple.

FEATURES
- Notifies you when your phone is out of range of your Fitbit.
- View the last know location of your Fitbit on a GPS enabled map.
- Set preferred reminder delay time for false positive avoidance.

********************************

HOW DO I KNOW IT'S WORKING?

First, follow the instructions located in the app. Then place your Fitbit on the Kitchen table and go for a walk with your iPhone.  When a notification appears on your Lock or Home screen with the message, ""Did you forget your Fitbit?"" it's working.  
  
""IF YOU TAKE A STEP WITHOUT YOUR FITBIT DID YOU EVEN MOVE?""

""FORGOT MY FITBIT AT HOME. All THAT WALKING I DID TODAY, COMPLETELY WASTED""

""I FOTGOT MY FITBIT.  THAT WHOLE WORKOUT DIDN'T EVEN COUNT.""
 
Please read the instructions in the app for how to setup your Fitbit to work with the app.

"What is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. It does not say anything about which foods to eat, but rather when you should eat them. 

There are several different intermittent fasting methods, all of which split the day or week into eating periods and fasting periods. Most people already ""fast"" every day, while they sleep. Intermittent fasting can be as simple as extending that fast a little longer. You can do this by skipping breakfast, eating your first meal at noon and your last meal at 8 pm.

Then you're technically fasting for 16 hours every day, and restricting your eating to an 8-hour eating window. This is the most popular form of intermittent fasting, known as the 16/8 method.

Despite what you may think, intermittent fasting is actually fairly easy to do. Many people report feeling better and having more energy during a fast.

Hunger is usually not that big of an issue, although it can be a problem in the beginning, while your body is getting used to not eating for extended periods of time.

No food is allowed during the fasting period, but you can drink water, coffee, tea and other non-caloric beverages.

Some forms of intermittent fasting allow small amounts of low-calorie foods during the fasting period.

Taking supplements is generally allowed while fasting, as long as there are no calories in them.

What iFasting app can do for you?

This app iFasting also called as inter fasting app, intermittent fasting app make fasting activities more manageable. With iFasting you can easily monitor the progress of your fasting by day, week and even month. It will give you informative results of your fasting to encourage you in continuing your endeavor of a healthy lifestyle.

"Important:

Blood Pressure Log does not measure your blood pressure. To do so, you must use a sphygmomanometer (also known as a blood pressure monitor) approved by your governing health body, like the FDA in the US.


What you can do with Blood Pressure Log:

✔ You can chart your blood pressure (BP) measurements and easily determine your BP range for each reading, whether it is high, low, or normal. The app will analyze, on the device (see our Privacy Policy), your measurements, and generate several graphs and charts for you to analyze your blood pressure numbers. Even more, it will compute advanced health markers like your pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, classification, trend, categories, and outlook.

✔ Blood Pressure Log allows you to journal every detail about your measurements like systolic and diastolic pressure (in millimeters of mercury or mmHg), your pulse (in beats per minute or bpm), different tags like any arrhythmia detected by your blood pressure cuff, date and time, position (standing, lying, or seating), extremity (right/left wrist or arm) and any special notes you need to add.

✔ Using the tag system, for instance, you can mark all readings taken by doctors allowing you to determine if your hypertension (HTN) is due to white coat syndrome. You can capture your high/low blood pressure symptoms, causes, and pills taken. Also, you can mark cases of possible orthostatic hypotension (or postural hypotension as is also known) for later analysis of your symptoms and probable causes. There are no limits on how many BP tags you can create and/or assign to each measurement so you can be as specific as needed.

✔ Blood Pressure Log has a powerful filtering mechanism to let you pinpoint specific reading(s) based on their blood pressure range, hypotension, hypertension, date, time, and tags. Using this tool, you can analyze measurements from a specific period, classification, or type. The best part is you can export all that data and share it with your doctor, family, and friends at any moment without limits.

✔ You can also set reminders or alarms from within the app to help you remember to take pills, go to appointments with your doctor, or just to take a measurement with your sphygmomanometer. We recommend setting a daily alarm for this last task since constant information will improve the app's ability to compute health markers like your pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, average systolic and diastolic pressure, and pulse. This will make its predictions and analysis more accurate, especially when it comes to detecting high blood pressure (hypertension), prehypertension, low blood pressure (hypotension), and more.

✔ Blood Pressure Log works with the most robust blood pressure guidelines in the world like the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), the Seventh Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) or Hypertension Canada (HC). You can switch between any of these guidelines at any moment depending on your needs, also you can let the app choose one for you based on your location.

✔ Blood Pressure Log supports several profiles for different people, that way you can chart different blood pressure readings, ranges, symptoms, and causes without interfering with each other. The app allows you to switch between profiles seamlessly and will show the appropriate information accordingly."

GI means Glycemic Index. It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.

The Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.

Net carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.

BMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.

About Mudras:
Mudra is a Sanskrit word which means posture or pose. In the word Mudra 'mud' means joy and 'ra' means produce. It produces joy and cheerfulness. Mudras originated from Hinduism and Buddhism. 200 Mudras are used in Bharatanatyam and 250 Mudras are in Mohiniattam, 108 Mudras used in Tantric rituals. In other terms Mudras are silent language of self expression and consisting of hand gestures and finger postures. 

Mudras involve the entire body and looks as a closed electrical circuit which can pass energy throughout the body. The physical body is made up of five elements. The Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring and Little finger represents Fire, Air, Sky, Earth and Water respectively. Imbalance of these five elements interrupts the immunity system and causes diseases. When a finger representing an element is brought into contact with the thumb element the disturbance is brought into balance, therefore the disease caused by the imbalance is cured. 

Usually from 5 to 45 minutes is required to practice everyday by using appropriate Mudra with proper pressure and touch including sitting position and breathing.

However the effectiveness of the Mudras not only depends on the practices but it also depends on the eating habit, diet and the lifestyle of a person.

Speciality of Mudras:
•  Mudras are used extensively in Yoga, Meditation and Dance.
•  It does not need any money or special ability to be performed but it just needs some patience.

"After giving birth, you may still have some fat and weight leftover you can get rid of. Burn off excess baby weight with help from a professional fitness trainer.

Losing the baby weight: many women wonder how long it takes to lose baby weight and bounce back to a pre-baby body. While many of us wish we could magically lose all those extra pregnancy pounds the moment baby finally arrives, the fact is no one snaps right back to her pre-baby body so quickly.

Though you may be eager to jump into a workout program or diet, easing into light exercise is crucial for keeping your body safe and injury-free. Even the fittest moms may have trouble getting back to exercise. After all, having a baby is a major ordeal and something you'll need time to recover from. You'll need clearance from your doctor and, depending on what kind of birth you had, it may be 4 to 8 weeks before you can engage in serious exercise.

But getting your body back after having a baby is not as hard as you might think.
Research shows that starting a regular exercise program soon after giving birth is not only good for your overall health, but may also help reduce the risk of postpartum depression.

This workout programs uses pure bodyweight exercises to safely get your body back into exercise after having a baby.  Get your heart rate up for cardio for weight loss, as well as strengthen to tone and tighten your muscles. We added options for all fitness levels.

Getting flatter abs involves losing overall body fat with a combination of cardio, strength training, and a healthy diet. Even then, you may still have a little fat around the lower belly. This is an area many women store excess fat, particularly after pregnancy, so try not to put too much pressure on yourself to get a flat belly.

Learn safe, healthy ways to lose weight after pregnancy and tips for fitting in exercise with your new schedule."

Swift Tabata will provide a guide with Tabata cardio that walks through the basics of what a Tabata workout is, the benefits in terms of physical and mental health, the risks and precautions, and a number of helpful tips when undergoing a HIIT workout like Tabata. This app will also present a number of simple and quick Tabata workouts and exercise activities that can be carried out at home or in the gym.

What Can Swift Tabata Help You? 
✔️Anaerobic and Aerobic Capacity Increase
The body’s aerobic capacity, also called its maximum oxygen uptake, is the greatest amount of oxygen it consumes when strenuously exercising. Anaerobic capacity is the maximum amount of energy that can be produced by the body in the absence of oxygen. 

✔️Burn Fat
Tabata training will raise your metabolism and heart rate in no time. Because you are going at such a high level of intensity, your body has to work much harder to keep up. Your metabolism will stay at a high not only during the workout, but after the workout as well. This means that your body will be burning fat even when you aren’t doing anything. When performing other forms of moderate cardio, you have to wait until your body gets into the “fat burning zone” in order to really burn fat.

✔️Protects Muscle Tissue
The last thing Tabata training does is cut into hard earned muscle tissue. With the short amount of time that tabata cardio takes to get a good workout, you won’t be eating away at any muscle tissue as you might during long durations of cardio. The Tabata method stress on muscle tissue, which tells your body that more muscle tissue is needed. As a result, the ratio of your lean body mass to fat goes up, and by choosing exercises that maximize the muscle mass worked, muscle tissue may increase.

✔️Save Time
No matter how busy you are, all it in our tabata video takes is four to eight minutes of this high intensity workout to get a great workout in. The availability of this workout is time saving in itself, as you don’t need to go to a gym to reap the benefits. All you need is your own body weight or some at home equipment like bands and dumbbells.

✔️Strength Training For Specific Body Parts:
Traps, Shoulders, Chest, Biceps, Forearm, Abs, Quads, Calves, Lats, Triceps, Middle Back, Glutes, Hamstrings.

✔️Make Workout Results More Satisfied for you
Maybe you have attempted various workouts, such as weight loss programs and gym rituals, while with a little effort though you worked really hard. Swift Tabata can help you make the workout results more satisfied through the courses we designed for you.
