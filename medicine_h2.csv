"Have you repeatedly considered switching to a diet of 1000 kcal or 1200 kcal? Thanks to calorie tables, you can carefully plan a diet menu for the whole day!

Calorie table app - how to lose weight using it?😊

If you want to be fit, you need to take care of what you eat. Diet and Calorie Table are the best Android apps,

Counting calories is one of the most popular ways to fight overweight. Thanks to the knowledge of calorie tables of products, we are able to plan each meal in such a way that its energy value does not exceed 250-300 kcal (because that's how much should provide 3 main dishes eaten during the day).

Calorie table - how to use it? 👍

Before you start preparing a meal, check the energy values of selected products in the calorie table, weigh them and add them together. In order for the result not to be distorted, think about buying kitchen scales, which will show values of approximately 1 g. During the diet, it will help you not only to choose the right portion of meals but also allow you to calculate accurately the number of kcal provided by the meal."
"Most exercises are safe to perform during pregnancy, as long as you exercise with caution and do not overdo it. 

Maintaining a regular exercise routine throughout your pregnancy can help you stay healthy and feel your best. Regular exercise during pregnancy can improve your posture and decrease some common discomforts such as backaches and fatigue. There is evidence that physical activity may prevent gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy), relieve stress, and build more stamina needed for labor and delivery.

Exercising for 30 minutes on most, or all, days can benefit your health during pregnancy. Exercising for just 20 minutes, 3 or 4 days a week, is still beneficial, as well. The important thing is to be active and get your blood flowing.

We created several safe workouts and exercise programs to stay fit during pregnancy."

"You don’t need any special medical equipment to get your pulse and to keep track of your health state, just your phone camera! Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.
 
APPLIED METHOD:

Our app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique.

That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.
 
HOW TO USE:

Cover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.
 
TRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:

Get visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.

WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?

The keto diet (also known as a ketogenic diet, low carb diet and LCHF diet) is a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Maintaining a low carb diet is great for weight loss. Moreover, according to an increasing number of studies, a low carb diet helps reduce risk factors for diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and more!

WHY REDUCE CARBS ON A KETO DIET?

We’re beginning to understand that carbs in large quantities are more harmful than previously thought, while most fats are healthy & essential (the basis of a low carb diet).

When you eat lots of carbs, your blood sugar is consistently elevated and, as a result, so is insulin. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.

This insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.

A keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.

THE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!

The nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.

The keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.

When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:

• Lose body fat
• Have consistent energy levels during the day
• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating

HUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!

Keto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better. Each low carb recipe is delicious – we know because we only share the ones we love.

We’ve included hundreds of low carb recipes for you to choose from. The main goal of these low carb recipes is to:

• Keep carbs low – under 25g a day, ideally
• Increase your protein intake – aim for at least 60g a day
• Keep you full and satiated from delicious meals

THE BEGINNER'S KETO DIET GUIDE INCLUDES:

• What is the Keto Diet?
• Testing for Ketosis
• The Truth About Fat
• What are Macronutrients?
• Long-term Benefits of the Ketogenic Diet
• Day-to-Day Benefits

Please change to English in the following ways that case.

======================================

“Burn your fat with me!!” is a fitness app/dating sim that provides players with the motivation to work out through moé, a Japanese term describing that heart-melting feeling you get when you see an adorable female anime character. 



We call it moévation.

======================================

BYFWM 3rd Year Anniversary Special Update!

======================================
Version 4.5
Continuous Training Episodes Vol.1 Add. 
Training Character ""Erika"" Add.

Version 4.0
Back Extension (B.E.) exercises added
4 new episodes added
New Character - Sana Yamada (CV(En): Amanda Lee) added

Complete renewal of the User Interface

======================================

What is “Burn your fat with me!!”?

======================================

“Burn your fat with me!!” is the first in a series moévation fitness apps from Japanese indie developer Creative Freaks. The Japanese version, “Nensho!”, has reached over 100,000 downloads and has gained recognition among the otaku community for being the first moé-themed app to break into the iTunes Top 10 ranking and have a fully localized release.

======================================

How does it work?

======================================

At its core, “Burn your fat with me!!” is a Japanese visual novel game akin to the “Phoenix Wright” or “Professor Layton” series. But instead of building a case or solving puzzles, the player advances the story by clearing fitness goals, such as performing 50 sit-ups in three minutes.

======================================

What else is in it?

======================================

• Training Mode: It’s important to train regularly if you want to be able to clear some of the more difficult trials. In Training Mode you choose your exercise, target reps, and time limit, then train while Mayu counts your repetitions and cheers you on. Using Training Mode (Timed only) will also earn you Moévation Points which can be used to unlock bonus content like new episodes.



• Voice Collection: As you progress the story, you will unlock “training voices”, the lines Mayu will say during your workout to encourage (and sometimes scold) you. The Voice Collection menu lets you preview unlocked training voices as well as switch them on and off.

======================================

Specifications

======================================

Tested with iPhones4, 4S, iPhone5, 5S, iPhone6; iPod touch 4; and iPads 2 and 3

Compatible with iOS 7.0+;

Squat and deadlift: Guys who are strong in these specific lifts find planks are no problem.
HOLD IT 
If you don't have the core strength yet to do a regular plank, you can build up to it by doing a bent-knee plank. If you can hold a plank for more than two minutes with ease, you can move on to these tougher variations.

Ways to improve your plank time 
The longer you can hold the plank, the more resilient your lower back will be to injury, and the better your abs will look once you burn the fat off them. Follow these tips for longer plank times."

"Being active has never been more rewarding!  CARROT is a free app that rewards you financially for walking. By walking and achieving individualized activity goals, users earn virtual currencies that can be used to play games, compete in challenges, and earn rewards (such as digital gift cards) that are available right on the app. Those rewards can be won in live, real-time “instant” auctions!
 
CARROT has successfully gamified health and wellness, including several fun features available to all users. “CARROT Survivor” is a last-person-standing competition that challenges contestants to make their personal goals each and every day. “Versus” contests include weekly fantasy football competitions during the fall as well as similar games throughout the year. And CARROT’s “Unlockables” requires you to achieve a personal goal streak to access special prizes.
 
CARROT offers iPhone users several great features:
(1) Using Apple HealthKit, CARROT gives you a personalized “Activity Goal”, based on your own activity history, which is updated daily. Push yourself just a little bit more each day, make your personal goals, and then reap the rewards!
(2) CARROT’s Apple Watch app allows users to conveniently monitor their daily activity progress with just a tap.
(3) Using iBeacon technology, users can earn bonus Reward Points for activities such as community health programs and for visiting participating businesses. This is done in the background with low-energy Bluetooth.
(4) And as a fully inclusive program, CARROT provides the opportunity for manual wheelchair users to participate by being rewarded for their “pushes”, rather than “steps”. (Note: The use of an Apple Watch is required to accurately collect push data for use on CARROT.)
 
All CARROT users earn one Reward Point for each step they take. Premium Members – including those who are sponsored by their employer through a CARROT Corporate Wellness Program – can also earn CARROTcoins for achieving personalized activity goals. You can get a one-month Premium Membership with an In-App purchase.
 
With CARROT, there’s no need to purchase a wearable tracker – everything, including your steps data and rewards, is stored exclusively on your phone. The app doesn’t even have to be on or running for you to earn points. (But if you already own a tracker, CARROT accepts data from most popular devices.)
 
Would you like your employer to offer CARROT rewards to you and your coworkers? “CARROT Health & Wellness” is a special, low-cost program that offers employees exclusive company-sponsored rewards such as digital gift cards – available directly through the app – just for meeting daily activity goals. Employers can launch their own CARROT Wellness pilot program by entering their information on the CARROT “Wellness” screen.
 
Because CARROT respects your privacy, you have the option to sign in using your phone number, Facebook or anonymously. Anonymous (“Guest”) users should beware that, since all data is stored only on the device, you will permanently lose all relevant data and earned rewards if you log out or delete the app.
 
Many exclusive rewards are made available based on your location, and you can also receive bonus Reward Points for visiting CARROT businesses and other locations -- so please be sure to allow “location services”. (Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.)
 
Easy to use. Convenient. Personalized. Free. When it comes to Fitness Rewards, nothing beats CARROT!"

"Would you like to have music for meditation, therapy or yoga classes? ""Thunderstorm sounds"" is what you need!
Our soothing music app has 16 relaxing sounds of the rain, wind and thunder that help you to sleep:
Thunderstorm sounds.


Different rain sounds (nature sounds) help you and your children fall asleep faster. Our nature music 

A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm, a lightning storm, thundershower or simply a storm, is a form of turbulent weather characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere known as thunder. The meteorologically assigned cloud type associated with the thunderstorm is the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or no precipitation at all. Those that cause hail to fall are called hailstorms. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms may rotate, known as supercells. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.

Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitatedóthat is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystem, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness, relatively suspended sensory activity, and inactivity of nearly all voluntary muscles. It is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, and is more easily reversible than being in hibernation or a coma. Sleep is a heightened anabolic state, accentuating the growth and rejuvenation of the immune, nervous, skeletal and muscular systems. It is observed in all mammals, all birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or as an end in itself.

"Diabetic cooking doesn't have to be a challenge. These recipes make it easy to whip up delicious, healthy, diabetic-friendly meals. For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.

Whether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.

Losing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.

Nutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any. What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood glucose level in the range that your health care team recommends.

What is the Ketogenic Diet? 
The Ketogenic diet is a fast-growing low carbohydrate, high fat (lchf) diet similar to the Paleo diet, Atkins or any other meal plan that aims to limit carb intake. The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a keto diet plan is the amount of carbohydrates and proteins allowed on a daily basis. Keep in mind, the Keto diet is not a 'fad' and has been medically researched for hundreds of years.It is one of the only low carb, high protein diets that has significant scientific evidence backing it.

Why Keto? 
Compared to the western diet which consists largely of highly-refined carbohydrates, Ketosis, the utilization of fat ketones instead of glucose, can offer a lot of health advantages. Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight fast and consistently. However, scientific research suggests that ketosis goes further than that, such as lowering your blood pressure, risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, improving skin conditions and dental health, mood stabilization, and increasing energy levels.

"We will teach you how to get rid of bacteria vaginosis and diagnosis symptoms in order to effectively and quickly treatment. Vaginal odor is a sign of infection, but in fact, some odor is normal. During your period, you may notice a blood-like scent, which makes sense. A mild, musk-like scent at any time during your cycle can be normal.

A vaginal discharge relating to a vaginal yeast infection will have the appearance of cottage cheese and may have an odor that is slightly like bread or beer because the underlying cause of the infection is essentially a fungus.

A pungent scent or strong fishy smell is not normal and may indicate an infection. Speak to your doctor, especially if you’re experience itching, fever, or other symptoms.

A lot of people feel shame about their Vaginal odor smells, so try not to feel bad about it or make your partner feel bad about it. Your main concern should be pleasing your partner and having fun doing it. Of course, if you really can’t stand the taste you can use a dental dams or condoms! Dental dams and condoms not only protect the users but also keep you from tasting whatever you are orally pleasing. Most products that advertise getting rid of vaginal odor smells/tastes are actually really  bad for the vagina and vulva area and all the cleaning a vulva needs is washing with water."
"This app is a simple game app aimed at continuously watching Gabor Patch images without getting bored. 

Tap on the Gabor Patch image with the same pattern to erase it, and a new screen will appear when all are erased.

What is Gabor Patch?
It is a kind of striped pattern created by mathematical processing called the Gabor transform. 
It was developed by Dr. Dennis Gabor, the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics winner for his invention of holography. 
Originally, it was thought that looking at Gabor Patch transform images is likely to act on the visual cortex of the brain, and improvements were observed when used to restore eyesight with its adaptability. 
Looking at Gabor Patch images is said to be effective not only for myopia but also for presbyopia, astigmatism, and hyperopia, due to their effects on the visual cortex of the brain."

About FODMAPs and IBS
FODMAPs are short chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, especially for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, other food intolerances and stomach sensitivities. They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose and galactooligosaccharides, disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols).

The term is an acronym, derived from:

*Fermentable
*Oligo-
*Di-
*Mono-saccharides
*And
*Polyols 

Although these specific carbs are naturally present in the foods we eat, diet restriction has been found to improve symptom control in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and other stomach sensitivities. Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage. The main symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain, discomfort in association with frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits.

1. Ancient Yoga
A bit gentle stretching can make a significant impact. Yoga is a mind-body-soul treatment that’s frequently suggested to heal not only back pain but the stress that come with it. Yoga’s focus on balance and steadiness encourages your body to develop defences against the causes of back pain, which include weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, as well lack of flexibility in the hips. 
According to research yoga may even help reduce the need for pain medication.

2. Vedic Exercise / workout
Vedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge. This sponge action delivers nutrients to the disc.

Another vital effect of exercise is that it stretches and repairs muscles. It increases blood circulation to muscle thus boost optimum oxygen supply. 
Another advantage of back exercise is that the motion helps lubricate the facet joints, which are synovial joints that need proper motion.
3. Pranayama 
The breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‘extension’. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing. 
By breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed.

"Pull out your gym mat and get ready to do a series of movements that will stabilize and strengthen your core.
You’ll get stronger, more sculpted muscles and gain flexibility. You may also have better posture and a better sense of well-being.

If you are looking to strengthen your abdomen and pelvis as well as maintain good posture, then Pilates is for you. It also has a strong mind/body connection, so you may like it if you enjoy yoga but need a more intense core workout.

There is limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate lower back pain, improve strength, and prevent elderly people from falling. It has not been shown to be effective treatment for any medical condition.

Pilates is great for strengthening and toning your core and for increasing your flexibility, but it’s not a comprehensive strength building program. You will need to supplement it with some other exercises if you want to build up your arm or calf muscles. Talk to your trainer to see what would be best. And don’t forget your cardio!

Pilates involves precise moves and specific breathing techniques. It’s not for you if you prefer a less structured program. It also won’t fit your needs if you are looking for an aerobic workout.

Pilates can be very demanding, so start slowly. Instructors do not have to be licensed, so it’s best to get recommendations before selecting one."

"The vibration of these sounds helps activate, strengthen and cleanse the chakras. 
Enjoy the most relaxing chakra healing audios that exist. This chakra healing app is completely free .

The chakras are energy points that govern the physical body and regulate the uptake and energy expenditure in non-initiated or underdeveloped spiritually are closed or slightly open, when we develop our etheric, open the chakras. 


Chakras are our energy centers. Chakras are the openings for our life energy to flow in and out of our aura. The function of our chakras is to vitalize our physical body and to help us bring about the develop our self-consciousness. Using chakras meditation regularly will help you to stay balance and bring balance to your life.
The word chakra means wheel in Sanskrit and refers to the wheel of etheric energy that gives life to a part of the physical body. 

The energies directed to an astral body chakra also act on the physical body. To balance the flow of energy and marshal the different chakras there to open them and exercise them. The stones for your vibrational energy, help us, induce and achieve the desired effect.

My 7 Chakras Healing Meditation app features:
•  You can play music in the background. 
• 7 high quality Chakra music tracks (continuously) for each Chakra (Base, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Brow and Crown).
• 7 beautiful mandalas to focus your attention during meditation.
• Including the effect of the colors associated with the Chakra .
• Brief description of each Chakra ( In English and Hindi )
Note: Don't use this app while driving or operating heavy machinery. I am not responsible for anything you do while listening to these audios. 

Tips for using the app:

1. For the best experience, I recommend that you wear high-quality noise-isolation or noise-cancelling headphones. Some of these audios come with binaural beats which are completely useless if you don't wear headphones. Yes, you can use earphones but then you won't be having the amazing experience that I intended for you.

2. Don't try to heal all your chakras at once. Heal one every day of the week and repeat the following week. There are seven chakras just like there are seven days in the week, do one chakra per day followed by your daily meditation ritual.


 Another aspect of sonic chakra resonance has to do with the actual frequency or keynote of each chakra. There a multitudinous different keynotes and scales with regard to this.

"Resistance bands are a great addition to any strength training routine or rehabilitation program, and they come in a variety of sizes, lengths, and resistance levels.

They’re also portable and easy to store, so they’re perfect for home use, hotel workouts, or making the most of a small space at the gym. A resistance band is one of the most inexpensive, convenient pieces of workout equipment you can own. They are remarkably easy to learn to use, and allow you to create a remarkable range of exercises using a single piece of equipment.

In the world of strength training, resistance bands tend to fly under the radar—especially when compared to heavy hitting equipment like kettlebells and barbells. But what’s not to love about resistance bands? They’re lightweight, versatile, and easy to stow in a gym bag or carry-on, making them an ideal choice for the guy who wants to be able to train anytime, anywhere. You can use them on their own, or add them to more standard exercises to vary up your resistance for a more diverse workout.

Resistance bands give you a new way to work out and lose the weight, as well as tone up for a more defined muscular physique. They will target places on your body that can stabilize muscles that you don’t normally use."

"Heart rate or heartbeat is an important measure in health and fitness. Using Heart Rate Monitor app, you can measure and monitor your heart rate!


★ Free with unlimited recording
★ Easy to use with an intuitive design
★ Identifies heart rate training zones
★ Google Fit support
★ No additional hardware required

How to use the heart rate monitor free app to measure your heartbeat?

To use this heart rate monitor app, just put your finger on the phone's camera and stay still, the heart rate should be shown after several seconds.

What is a normal heart rate or heartbeat?

According to Mayo Clinic, a normal resting heartbeat rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM). However, keep in mind that many factors can influence the heart rate, including Activity level, Fitness level,  Body size, Emotion, etc. Generally, but not always, a lower heartbeat at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.

Consult your doctor if your resting heartbeat is consistently above 100 beats per minute or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heartbeat is below 60 beats a minute.

What are heart rate training zones?

Heart rate training zones are calculated using maximum heart Rate (MaxHR). Within each training zone, subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness. We have a similar definition to those used in Fitbit trackers:

- REST ZONE (up to 50% HRmax): This considers as resting zone.

- FAT BURN ZONE (50 to 70% of maximum): Recovery and warming up exercises should be completed in this zone. It’s called the fat burn zone because a higher percentage of calories are burnt from fat.

- CARDIO ZONE (70% to 85% of HRmax): Most of the main exercise should be completed in this zone.

- PEAK ZONE (greater than 85% of HRmax): This zone is ideal for short intense sessions (high-intensity interval training HIIT) to improve performance and speed.

This heart rate monitor app calculates and automatically saves your heart rate training zones.


WARNNING

- Heart rate monitor app should not be used as a medical device.
- If you have a medical condition or worried about your heart condition please always consult your GP.
- In some devices, the heart rate monitor app may make the LED flash very hot."

Many of us can remember fondly those times when our mothers soothed us to sleep with a familiar song or two. Now, as adults, we often find ourselves in need of a soothing bedtime lullaby for our own little ones, but sometimes the name or even the lyrics elude us.

No matter where on the planet or in what year you were born, your mother sang you a lullaby before putting you to sleep. Lullabies have existed throughout human history and some of the ones we sing to this day are hundreds of years old. Although no one is certain, it is believed that the name “lullabies” comes from the “lull”-ing and “by”-ing sounds one makes to help a baby fall asleep. Others believe the term comes from a Hebrew phrase, “Lilith-Abi” meaning “Lilith begone.” Lilith is a folkloric character who was believed to steal children in the night and these incantations were sounded to keep her away.
Here are some popular lullabies and their origins.

Brahms’ Lullaby (lullaby music, bedtime sounds, sounds to relax and sounds to sleep)
Originally titled “Weigenlied”, this song is the most popular tune you’ll find in baby mobiles or hear when a cartoon character gets knocked on the head. The tune was originally written for Bertha Faber, a young mother from Germany who wanted a new song to sing to her first newborn child.

Rock-a-bye Baby (bedtime meditation)
Bough breaks and cradles plunging from trees seem a little scary to sing about to a child, but it’s still one of the most famous lullabies around the world. There are a few different theories about the origin of this song. One is that it was written by English immigrants to America upon seeing Native American women rocking their babies in birch-bark cradles suspended from tree branches. Another theory is that it was written in the late 1700s about a family that lived in a tree and their children slept in hollowed out boughs. Regardless of its origins the words first appeared in Mother Goose’s Melody in 1765.

"Do you know the healthiest way to slim down?

Reading countless magazine articles, going on crash diets, or filling your body with “magic” diet pills is not the answer, although many people turn to those solutions. The best answer is also the easiest - Ask a nutritionist how to lose weight in a healthy way! 

His advice will most likely sound like this: ""Quick diets are dangerous and unhealthy, so you must control what you eat and how much you consume! Cut out the sweets and hamburgers. Monitor yourself and eat healthy food as much as possible. Also, you need to record all your meals in a journal and count the calories!""

At this point, you might be thinking…Use a journal as a calorie counter? How boring! 

As millions of people will admit, after two or three days, you'll simply stop using the journal and return to your bad, overeating habits…

Furthermore, how much of your day did you spend running, walking, jumping, or swimming? Record all of your various types of physical training in the app and it will recalculate your dietary intake and make sure that your body’s caloric intake accounts for your exercise.

Don’t forget to weigh in! ""Lose Weight Without Dieting"" tracks your weight, as well as your bust, waist, and thigh measurements, so you can monitor your progress towards your slimmed down goals! The easy-to-read graphs will be a source of motivation and encouragement to keep working.

All you need to do is to cook the foods we suggest and do the recommended exercises to achieve all your goals!

"How to Reduce Blood Pressure - These Facts May Save Your Life, According to the American Heart Association, about one in three adults in the United States suffer with high blood pressure. More so, nearly one- third of these Americans aren't aware that they have developed it. Often referred to as ""silent killer,"" hypertension can lead to other serious conditions if left untreated. Unfortunately, many Americans do not know how to reduce blood pressure, therefore the disease harmfully progresses.

Read How to Reduce Blood Pressure:

Physicians provide extensive medical advice and drug therapy following diagnosis. Therefore, each hypertensive patient will effectively learn how to reduce high blood pressure. High blood pressure cannot be cured, yet it can be controlled through the implementation of prescriptive medications and life-style modifications.

There are several types of anti-hypertensive drugs that physicians prescribe according to the individual needs of the patient. Additionally, there are several natural ways to reduce elevated blood pressure, which involves healthy life- style changes.

An anti-hypertensive medication that is prescribed to patients is the thiazide diuretics. The thiazide diuretics are used to lower the resistance of the peripheral vascular or lower the pressure in the walls of the blood vessels.

However, this drug is commonly known to help excrete sodium from the body; thereby lowering blood volume. Another anti-hypertensive drug is the peripheral vasodilators which reduce blood pressure by relaxing the force of contraction of the muscles in the heart.

When prescribed, the dosages are dependent upon the status of the existing blood pressure and the seriousness of pre-existing conditions that increased the risk of developing it initially. Coincidentally, the dosages may be decreased once the blood pressure levels have been reduced.

Health care professionals also provide other advice on how to reduce blood pressure. Generally, they often recommend life- style changes that not only reduce the blood pressure, but also help reduce the persistence of annoying side effects caused by the medications. In most cases, the risks for high blood pressure are increased simply due to the decline in practicing healthy life-style regimens. Physicians advise hypertensive patients to eat a healthy diet, to loose weight, and to exercise daily. A healthy diet may consists of fruits and vegetables, foods rich in potassium, low calorie and low-fat foods and/or foods low in sodium.

Exercise may consist of walking, climbing stairs (as opposed to using the elevator), or yoga. Incidentally, you will loose weight from practicing both of these recommendations. These three important components along with anti-hypertensive medications are effective ways to control and possible prevent elevated blood pressure.

🔅 Remember🔅

Weight loss is a long term journey and a lifestyle change. Experts suggest that you should aim to lose no more than than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) a week to keep your body from regaining the weight you have lost once you are ready to maintain. This app allows you to keep track of your BMI, body fat percentage and overall weight loss so you can monitor how much weight you are losing each weigh-in.

❗Note about BMI, Body Fat and Ideal Weight ❗

Please don’t leave a bad review if you find the app's calculations are incorrect. BMI, Body Fat % and Ideal Weight calculations within the app are estimations based on your inputted data and are based on commonly used scientific formulas (described in the app). These calculations have limitations as they are based on the average body type and do not take into account the differences. For more accurate results, please see an expert (such as a personal trainer) and then enter your correct measurements manually into the app."

"Blue light from the phone is a cause of eye fatigue. It disturbs your sleep and harms your eye health. The night shift function has been scientifically proven to reduce blue light. By adjusting the screen to soft light, it relieves eye fatigue, helps you sleep well and improves your vision health. 100% FREE and effective for eye care!

Features

√ Night filter shifts your screen to natural warm light
√ Help you gain one more hour of sleep
√ Protect your eyes for 24 hours with the auto-timer
√ Help maintain healthy eye habits
√ Save your battery by 15%
√ Get better sleep by reducing blue light

WHAT IS BLUE LIGHT?
Blue light is the visible light spectrum (380-550nm) for circadian regulation. It contains more energy than other visible light types, so it may damage your retinal cells.

WHY SHOULD I USE BLUE LIGHT FILTER?
Research shows that exposure to blue light imposes serious threats to retinal neurons, causes eye strain, dry eyes, and inhibits the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. With our night shift function, your vision health will be greatly improved.

CAN BLUE LIGHT FILTER IMPROVE MY SLEEP?
Yes. Natural exposure to blue light during the daylight hours boosts people's energy, alertness and mood; however, it will disturb your sleep at night.(from wiki) Blue light filter can effectively reduce blue light from the screen and help you get better sleep.

"Seriously, getting lean sexy thighs is not out of your reach. That's why this 30 day thigh slimming challenge was created. For this challenge, the workouts will be focused on losing fat and building stronger and toned thighs.

It has different workout challenges that you will do daily and a calendar will be provided so that you can follow it easily.

Our thighs are often one of the most stubborn areas to slim down and tone up. While the outer-thigh muscles tend to get worked more often from common exercises like walking or running, the inner-thigh muscles are often ignored. Increasing muscle tissue not only burns calories but also firms up that area of the body. Through Pilates exercises you will be able to further improve your thigh strength without creating bulk. That’s because Pilates, much like ballet, was designed to create long lean muscles. Pilates is also great because you don’t need any equipment or a gym to do the exercises.

While it is impossible to target weight loss to one particular body part, there are specific exercises that you can do to firm and tone legs, which ultimately leads to a smaller, slimmer lower body. Therefore, these workout programs are combinations of targeted thigh exercises and cardio. By doing this you will get far better results.

Whether you're a beginner or advanced, this slimmer thigh challenge is doable for anyone. Follow our thigh slimming workouts to get lean legs; the exercises can be done at the gym or at home."

"You hear a lot about athletes and protein. And while it’s true that some athletes who participate in strenuous exercise may have a slightly increased need to get some quality protein in their diet, it may not be as much as you think.

All the energy we need to maintain our body and mind, as well as the fuel to help us exercise comes from the foods we eat and the fluids we drink. To determine the right amount of calories, and nutrients to consume, it’s helpful to consider how we use our energy stores on a daily basis and replace energy accordingly."

"Blood Pressure Check - Heart Rate Monitor Fitness Tracker is a free app which allows user to keep their health uptodate by testing BP, Heart Rate, Weight, Body, etc. Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Most of this pressure is due to work done by the heart by pumping blood through the circulatory system. Used without further specification, ""blood pressure"" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation. In medicine, a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips. The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck, wrist, at the groin, behind the knee, near the ankle joint, and on foot. Pulse is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.

Body Mass Index (BMI) or Quitilet Index is the height and weight of a person. One BMI is calculated by dividing the weight of a person by the class of his height and the measurement of globally published kg /meter2. The weight is expressed in kg and height meter. BMI refers to the body weight of tissue (muscle, fat, bone) in a persons body. And based on this, a person is diagnosed with low weight, normal weight, overweight or obese. But there are some debates about the classification of BMI. Generally accepted and classified weight (average) for an adult person, sponsored by the World Health Organization: Light weight: less than 18.5, Normal weight: 18.5 to 24,  Extra weight: 25 to 30, Obese: More than 30.

The height ratio of a persons waist, the ratio of structure to one waist and is called. It is calculated by dividing the waist circumference in height, where the waist circumference and height are measured with the same magnitude. The ratio of height to the waist is the measurement of fat in the body. If the height ratio is higher than the waist then the body is more likely to have fatty heart disease. It is related to stomach obesity. N11,000 people have been observing for more than 8 years from a statistical study in 2010. It is known that the ratio of high-altitude verses from the widely used benchmark BME to measure the risk of heart attack, stroke or death is better.

"The beep test, or 20-m shuttle run test, is a progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance test employed by many international sporting teams. This app will lead you through a series of stages that have different tasks, used to estimate your VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake)!

APP FEATURES

Heart Monitor:
Monitoring devices are supported through Bluetooth LE (Low Energy).

Virtual Coach: 
Speech Synthesis will lead you at Test Start and a Whistle will signal each lap and level changes;

Progress Tracking:
each session is recorded so you can review your best performances;

MULTI STAGE FITNESS TEST RULES

The pacer test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 meters apart from side to side. These runs are synchronised with the app, which plays beeps (whistles) at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athlete to increase their speed over the course of the test, until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). It allowed to get one beep before the person makes the line, but if the person being tested does not make the next interval then the most recent level they completed is their final score. The test is typically structured into 21 'levels', each of which lasts around 62 seconds. The interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5 km/h, increasing by 0.5 km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 2 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test."

"How to lose belly fat in 30 days 
Concerned about your belly fat, and want it gone fast? Here're few tips for the best way to lose belly fat in 1 month .
Lose Belly Fat app is designed specifically for you to quickly and safely lose weight. Workout a few minutes a day at home or anywhere! You do not need any additional equipment. You can get a flat stomach in just a few weeks!
Whether you're a woman looking for ways on how to burn belly fat, or a man looking for best way to lose belly fat for men, the goal is achievable if you follow the steps mentioned here in this video for steps on how to lose belly fat in 30 days.
When the question of how to lose stomach fat fast is asked, it should be how many pounds, because losing belly in a week, could mean 2 pounds, 4 pounds, or even a pound of belly fat. 
The question of how to lose stomach fat in a week cannot be overstated, sure some people may doubt it, but losing belly fat in a month is easily doable and has been done before. 

We have prepared diet for you, weight loss and workout plans for 30 days. Following this plan, you can lose those extra pounds and make your body even more beautiful. The load will gradually increase, so do not forget about the rest. Exercise prepared specifically for the home and can be done by anyone anywhere.

Learn the truth about how the body stores and removes belly fat, then adjust your lifestyle for maximum fat reduction.
Belly fat, or visceral fat, is an especially harmful type of fat that sits around your organs. 
The first week of belly fat loss are the most important, because changes to diet and exercise can result in relatively large weight loss in a short time.

EXERCISES TO LOSE BELLY FAT FAST : Keep in mind that in order to lose belly fat, calories need to be burnt. Running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming, tennis, dancing, and cycling are great exercises for burning fat. Cardiovascular exercises provide oxygen to the body, and thereby help in burning calories. Plus, aerobic exercises also provide a boost to the metabolism. The ideal duration of your cardio workout should be 30 to 45 minutes, about three times a week, or more.

To get a flatter, more defined stomach, you need to concentrate on core exercises that tone and strengthen the abdominal muscles. However, you should not keep your hopes tagged with only these exercises. In order to see an overall effect, as in a flattened stomach and a strong, toned, and healthy body, you need to perform other fat-burning exercises as well. This way, you will teach your muscles to be able to lose the excess fat. The following stomach toning exercises are effective, simple, and don't require any equipment.

"Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.

How the app works:
At first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)
The core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.
Green-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.

Using the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favorite camembert you can replace during the pregnancy.

By clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.
By the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.

We wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!

"The chest radiograph is a very commonly requested examination and it is probably the hardest plain film to interpret correctly. It is, however, often performed out of hours with interpretation undertaken by relatively junior members of staff, frequently with no senior radiological advice available. All the X-rays are accompanied by a simple line diagram outlining where the abnormality is.

The app features over 300 high quality images, along with a range of case story images designed to enable readers to test and develop their interpretation skills. Text on improving X-ray and other diagnostic imaging test interpretation skills, for students and radiologists.

*Covers the full range of common radiological problems.
*Includes valuable advice on how to examine an X-ray.
*Assists the doctor in determining the nature of the abnormality.
*Points the clinician towards a possible differential diagnosis.
*Now presented in two-colour to enhance the appearance of the text.
*New material includes an introduction to thoracic CT scanning indicating the usefulness of these scans where appropriate.

A chest X-ray test is a very common, non-invasive radiology test that produces an image of the chest and the internal organs. To produce a chest X-ray test, the chest is briefly exposed to radiation from an X-ray machine and an image is produced on a film or into a digital computer. Chest X-ray is also referred to as a chest radiograph, chest roentgenogram, or CXR.

By the end of this lecture, the learner will be able to:
Utilize a systematic and reliable approach in CXR evaluation
Correlate basic CXR findings with clinical evaluation in order to reach a diagnosis
In general, a chest X-ray test is a simple, quick, inexpensive, and relatively harmless procedure with minimal risk of radiation.

Interpreting Medical X-Rays is an excellent, simple app is reasonably written and would be recommended to all healthcare professionals who are involved with the interpretation of plain chest radiographs.' 
Interpreting Chest X-Rays was a delight to read and review. It is a concise text that covers the basics of chest radiography.

Radiological imaging is now accessible to a wide range of healthcare workers, many of whom are increasingly taking on extended roles. This app will equip all healthcare professionals, including medical students, chest physicians, radiographers and radiologists, with the techniques and knowledge required to interpret plain chest radiographs.

It is not an exhaustive text, but concentrates on interpretive skills and pattern recognition – these help the reader to understand the pitfalls and spot the clues that will allow them to correctly interpret the chest X-rays they will encounter in their daily practice.
The app features over 300 high quality images, along with a range of case story images designed to enable readers to test and develop their interpretation skills.
Interpreting Chest X-Rays is a handy ready reference that will help you to avoid making errors interpreting chest X-rays and decide, for example:

Contents
1 Technique 
2 Anatomy 
3 In-built errors of interpretation 
4 The fundamentals of CXR interpretation 
5 Pattern recognition 
6 Abnormalities of the thoracic cage and chest wall 
7 Lung tumours 
8 Pneumonias
9 Chronic airways disease

"The plank exercise is an isometric fitness core exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push-up for the maximum possible time. Out fitness app Plank Workout - 30 Days Challenge helps to achieve high result, lose weight and gain a steel abs.

Benefits of the Plank
The plank strengthens and tones an array of muscles found all over your body, including your shoulders, arms, lower back and rump, but the primary target is the abs.

How to do a perfect Plank
The plank is all about posture. Your weight should be on the balls of your feet and your elbows, with your hands locked together in front. Keep your back and hips aligned so you form a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. Brace your abdominals, and don’t raise or lower those hips. If even adopting the position for this fitness workout exercise proves impossible, start with your knees on the ground. Once you can hold this bent-knee plank for two minutes, get back on those toes.

How long should you hold a Plank?
Most people don't use the muscles properly or don't take the right position when they set the goal of standing for as long as possible. If you can hold the plank for only one minute, lowering your hips or lifting them too high, it is best to reduce the fitness exercise time, but do it right.

Time goals for the Plank:
* 30 sec – novice
* 1 min – average
* 1 min 30 sec – good
* 2 min – very good
* 3 min – excellent
* 5 min – abs workout master
* 8 hr 1 min – the official Guinness World Record for the Plank

Complete all 30 days plank workout challenges
Our fitness app Plank Workout - 30 Days Challenge has 3 different difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. After completing a 30 days challenge for a beginner, you can go to the next level and begin to conquer a new peak. At an advanced level, you can challenge your abs. You can also conduct your own plank workout training, choosing the time for yourself.

Train and Plank to obey you!"

"The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the international ""standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes"". Its full official name is International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.

The ICD is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations System. The ICD is designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases.


The ICD is published by the WHO and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. Like the analogous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (which is limited to psychiatric disorders), the ICD is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and provide diagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically based classificatory diagnostic system for health care related issues of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).

The data of this App comes from the live feed of US Embassy. 

What is the Beijing air pollution index and what does it measure? 

This is a live feed of air quality measurements from a monitoring station in the US embassy in downtown Beijing. The station measures PM2.5 particles. This means particles that are smaller than 2.5 microns in size, like soot from diesel engines. Research shows that these are the most dangerous pollutants. The first part is the date and time. Then comes the measurement, then an index that is calculated from the measurement, then a health impact rating. Anything below 100 is good, anything above 100 is a cause for concern. The feed shows the four most recent measurements in rotation (they are generally hourly), and today's average. 

More information and research on the health risks posed by PM2.5 particles

The ancient Hindu science of health  and medicine , based on  maintaining balance among five  elements earth, air, fire, water and ether.
Ayurveda is the traditional healing modality of the Vedic culture from India. It is said to be 2000 to 5000 years old, meaning it has stood the test of time.
The main problems with the present system are user has to go through many unknown sites or has to go through a lot of garbage data to get specific information.

"You're a female and you want to get a toned body? Our workout routine will help you.
Women often start working out to tone their body, get a better butt and lose their belly fat. During this weight training for women, we will put an emphasis on these areas but also work on other important muscle groups.

This 30-day body-toning workout plan for beginners is a great routine to follow if you’re just getting started on your fitness journey!

Every woman is familiar with those tricky trouble zones that take a little extra work to tighten and tone. Our workout routines for women will work your entire body, sculpting your muscles and shredding excess fat. Having a toned body actually means that you have strong muscles with a low percentage of body fat, which provides this toning effect.

You don't need a gym membership to melt that unwanted flab and look fit. In fact, you don't even need equipment.
With minimal equipment and the convenience of home, these high-energy home workouts for women can help you get fit and lean fast. Combining cardio and strength, this full body workout burns calories fast. It can be carried out at home with no equipment. The strength exercises uses only body weight, making sure the female watchers will tone but not build their muscles.

Bodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that we use in our daily lives. Every bodyweight exercise involved utilizes multiple muscle groups, gets your heart rate pumping, and burns tons of calories. Essentially, circuit weight training, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns a lot more calories than steady cardio. When you strength train, you burn calories. Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterwards rebuilding your muscles, which in turns burns even more calories.

App features:
- 6 Workouts for beginners and advanced at the comfort of your own home.
- 11 Workout Programs, varying from 30 days to 12 weeks.

"The 30-day splits challenge is a training program designed to boost the body’s flexibility, especially the ability to perform full splits with ease. 

The Ultimate Guide on How To Do The Splits. The best middle splits stretches, stretching routine, 30 day splits challenge and more.

Challenge yourself to this fun activity which will get you super flexible and teach you a cool party trick!

Always wanted to be able to do the splits but never thought you could? Look no further; this challenge will get you closer than you think. There’s absolutely no doubt about it: being able to do the splits is awesome. Whether you want to get to your splits for dance, ballet, gymnastics, cheerleading or martial arts we’ve got you covered.

Splits in 30 Days
The splits challenge has been especially designed for complete beginners, so take all the time you need in reaching your goal. Even if you are a bit more advanced, make sure you complete the warm up and each step daily to keep yourself injury free.

Flexibility is the key to unleashing power and speed by increasing the range of motion active (agonist) muscles have to travel before they are held back by the opposing (antagonist) ones. Being more flexible can also reduce the chances of injury when exercising, though the biggest benefit will be in the way you walk and stand. This 30-day program will help you increase your flexibility. The program utilises a mixture of active (leg raises) and passive (holding the splits position) stretching techniques to give you the fastest gains possible in the shortest time.

In this plan you will stretch your muscles and loosen your hips leaving you closer and closer to touching the floor each time.

Stretches for splits
Flexibility is one of the key factors to increase the power and speed, if you are flexible enough you can reduces the chances of injury when you are doing a workout or playing any sport. Flexibility increases your range of motion. With the help of this 30 day split challenge program you can increase your flexibility.

If you want to get the splits, you must commit to working at it everyday. We made multiple workout challenges and yoga sequences for you that will target every muscle you need in order to achieve full leg flexibility. Treat this as a 30 Day Challenge, where you will dedicate just 7 to 15 minutes each day and practice these stretches. If you commit yourself to that, you will be down in splits in no time."

This application offers different ways of estimating the gender of the child, in particular:

  - blood's Rh factor of parents (probability ~ 50%);

In addition to planning the sex of a child, you can check out all of the above methods on an already-born children (your own, parents, friends, etc.), to form your own credibility to this or that technique.

"Activate your brain by binaural beats meditation according to what you need to do ore perform.
this application includes 5 binaural beats frequencies of your selection :
* alpha waves - relaxation while awake , pre-sleep and pre-wake.
* beta waves - active , busy or anxious thinking , active concentration and cognition.
* gamma waves - higher mental activity , perception , problem solving , fear release.
* theta waves - dreams , deep meditation , REM sleep.
* delta waves - deep dreamless sleep , loss of body awareness.

* It also include sounds of a nature that you can add as a background relaxation sound to the binaural waves.

what are binaural beats ?

Binaural beats occur when we hear two different frequencies, one in each ear. A binaural beat is defined as the difference between the two pitches. When you hear a 200Hz sound in one ear and a 190Hz sound in the other, you’ll hear a 10Hz binaural beat ( 200 - 190 = 10).

Binaural beats are auditory artifacts. In our example above, there is no 10Hz sound yet we “hear” one anyway. You must use headphones to have stereo separation. Speakers won’t work, you have to use stereo headphones or ear buds.

Why listen to binaural beats? Because they can increase specific brainwave frequencies as our brain mimics the frequencies we hear within the binaural beat. Let’s say you want to increase your alpha brainwaves. Listen to a binaural beat in the alpha range (8-12 Hz). This phenomena is called entrainment or frequency-following response."

● Science Behind App -

It is proven scientifically that if we practice something for 21 days on a regular basis then it becomes our habit. So we have created 21 days habit for some diseases so that people can make their habit to exercise regularly in order to get rid of their health problems.

● Water Reminder -

Another basic necessity to lead a healthy life apart from breathing is water. In our busy lives we often don't think of the minimum water requirement in our body which results in dehydration and make our body water deficient. One must take a minimum quantity of water required according to body weight and height. Our app includes the water module also. It gives the notification to drink water at regular intervals so that our body doesn't face water deficiency.

We look forward to welcome you here :)

"What is Chakra Meditation Balancing?

We created this FREE app to help you balance your 7 Chakras. Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body.The most important ones are seven, and they influence your life flow.

In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.

How to Balance your Chakras?

Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain tones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.

The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. This app was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.

We put a lot of passion in creating this app, and decided to make it FREE so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.
For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.

*Chakra Meditation Balancing includes*
- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras
- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.
- HealthKit integration! Now you can choose whether to log your timer sessions to the Health app as ""Mindful Minutes"".
- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.
- High definition background, created for iPad Retina display but available on all Apple devices.

Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:

Flexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.

Deeply stretch your legs
When doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. Doctors will recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.

Boost your circulation
Splits lengthen your muscles and improve your circulation by increasing blood flow to your muscles.

Please get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.

"Human body is a form of life which is a tiny and well harmonized Universe. For this reason the body has everything needed to support its life and to exist in Nature as a complete and independent phenomenon.

""Su"" means a hand, and ""Jok"" means a foot. This App describes the systems of correspondence of hands and feet which are panels of remote control of a person's health. These treatment systems function as a kind of small clinics which cure the body's illnesses in a natural way.

If one carefully analyses how closely our hands and feet follow the structure of our body we will be able to understand the mechanics of these treatment systems and to determine the points and areas that have to be stimulated in case of an illness.

Thanks to Nature, our hands and feet resemble our body in structure. They incorporate the primordial Will to cure and are designed for man to use this gift to be healthy. Through this treatment system Nature indicates clearly its purposes and its Love, and tries to help man to stay healthy. At the same time Nature teaches us a
certain lesson, the lesson of the Spirit of Independence, of the search for deliverance of diseases on their own.

Features :
- High effect : When applied properly, an evident effect is often felt within a few minutes, sometimes even seconds.

- Totally safe usage : This system of cure is not man-made. Man has just discovered it, but its origins are in Nature. That is why the system is powerful and safe. Stimulation of correspondence points brings about a cure. It never harms man, just produces no effect if applied improperly.

- A universal method : Su Jok Therapy can be used to treat any part of one's body, any organ, and any joint.

- Accessible to anybody : Su Jok Therapy has nothing to be learned and memorized. Dinned knowledge gets forgotten in no time. Once the method is grasped it stays usable life-long.

"Among the ""deep tests"" in Psychology, the Lüscher Color Test is the fastest to perform and, despite its simplicity of application, it is a powerful tool for revealing physical and psychological stress sources, anxieties, repressed personality traits and so much more.

Functional psychology is the name given to the theoretical field that relates the preference for colors to the psychology of personality.

Colors have great significance for humans in many ways, surrounding humanity from all sides since time immemorial, which makes color psychology a field of great importance in understanding the psychological and physiological factors involved in both the specific preference for a color and the influences on human behavior.

""Color blindness"" does not interfere, because the instinctive response to color in terms of contrast makes it possible that the Lüscher Test is a valid instrument even in cases of defects in color vision or even real color blindness, since the acceptability of a certain color is somatically, or bodily, related to the degree of anabolism or catabolism necessary to the organism.

The interpretations provided by the Max Lüscher Color Test can be quite personal and so it is advisable to be cautious with the outcome, because it can be occasionally not only upsetting, but can also be ""far off the mark"". The test should not be treated as a game or used as a weapon in personal disputes.

Versions of the android above 4.4 KitKat now have the ability to export test results to a PDF file stored in the external memory of the device. These stored tests remain in the device memory after uninstalling the Lüscher Color Test and can be removed within the application by clicking and holding on the names, or accessing the data with a file manager.

We hope the test is useful for your self-knowledge!

***
Thanks to Dr. Max Lüscher (1923-2017) for the development of this fabulous device available to psychology since 1947, greatly simplifying the application of a deep psychological test, facilitating numerous applications in various areas. We thank Kai Arste for the transcription of the algorithm to script and the organization of the result array, which facilitated the translation into the Java language and the translation into Portuguese and Spanish.

***
Attention: Only a psychologist can provide a reliable analysis of your mental and emotional health. Every psychological test requires human validation, and its result can be legitimized by people close to you, who have coexistence and knowledge of your personality."

"IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros) is the easiest and fastest way to calculate your daily calorie and nutrition requirements. This is the most precise app on the market giving you daily calculation of calories,carbohydrates,protein,fat and much more by only providing the user with two statistics,their weight and height.

MyFitness calculator Includes:-
 
• TDEE Calculator = (Total Calories intake calculator ) How many calories should you be consuming each day?
• Macros Nutrients Calculator - How many grams of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat should you be eating at each
meal? 
• BMI  Calculator
• BMR Calculator = Basal Metalbolic Rate
• One Rep Max Calculator
• Water Intake Calculator (Water your body) Water consumption calculator – calculates/suggests to you a goal to reach each day
• Max Heart Calculator
• Tablet-optimized UI 
• Metric and imperial systems are supported
• Calculate all major nutrients: calories, fat, protein, carbs, 

• Body Mass Index( BMI Calculator ): is defined as the body weight divided by the square of the height. BMI Calculator provides a rough guide since it doesn't take into account a persons build or the composition of the body weight. Just enter your weight and height and get the BMI value and also your ideal weight range. -BMI Calculator can be used to find your healthy weight if you want to lose weight or are on diet. 

TDEE is the amount calories your body burns in a 24 hour period, sleeping, working, exercising, playing and even digesting food!
The  IIFYM TDEE Calculator is designed to give you your exact TDEE based on a few key factors (BMR + TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE).

TDEE is the most important bit of information available to us when trying to gain muscle or burn fat and lose weight which is why the IIFYM TDEE Calculator is based on the most exact TDEE formulas available.

 
Fat Weight Loss Secret 
• If we eat more calories than our body requires, we will gain weight watchers.
• If we eat less calories than our body needs, we will lose weight watchers.
• Unless we know exactly what our TDEE is, we have no way of knowing how many calories to consume to burn body fat or gain muscle


BMR = Basal Metalbolic Rate (similar to RMR = Resting Metabolic Rate)
Your BMR (BMR calcualtor) is represents the number of calories your body burns at rest. The  BMR calcualtor will calculate the precise amount of calories your individual body requires to keep you alive.
 

The BMR Calculator is not a TDEE Calculator so you should not base any dietary decision on the number our BMR calculator spits out"

"Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions and practices of the culinary arts of Korea. Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, and (at least in the South) meats. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, napa cabbage.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Grains have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Chicken has played an important role as a protein in Korean recipes. Korean cuisine uses a wide variety of vegetables, which are often served uncooked, either in salads or pickles, as well as cooked in various stews, stir-fried dishes, and other hot dishes. Soups are a common part of any Korean meal. Unlike other cultures, in Korean culture, soup is served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning of the end of the meal, as an accompaniment to rice along with other banchan. 

Many easy Korean dishes are simple to make and are delicious as dinner, so don't think each of your Korean meals needs hours of preparation. With the main dish and a couple of side dishes, you'll still impress any Korean foodie. Noodles or noodle dishes in Korean cuisine are common. In Korean cuisine, tea, or cha, refers to various types of herbal tea that can be served hot or cold.

There is a proverb:

""Sow a habit - reap a character. Sow a character - reap a fate"". If you want a lucky fate - start by reconsidering your habits.

Freedom was created just to help you with this difficult task. Each of us has habits which determine a model of behavior and a way of thinking. Habits can be good, like morning exercises or evening jogging, and bad ones.

If you try to change all the habits at once, things are likely to get out of control. You may be frustrated by the fact that it may take more than a month to get rid of bad habits. But it's worth spending a month to change one habit - and that will change your life!

Nothing is more permanent than temporary.
Take it into consideration, when you want to postpone a new life until Monday. The sooner you start, the easier it will be for you.


What shall you start with? 

What do you spend your precious time on? Do you smoke cigarettes not thinking about harm to your health and budget? Turn on TV in the morning, and that’s why forget all the plans for the day?
Imagine your ideal life. What is it full of? Include these things in the list of your new habits. Yoga, orange juice in the morning, get a dog and walk it every day ... What will you choose? Now it’s time to get rid of what is stealing your time, your money, your life. Now you know what to do. And Freedom is on your side!


But how will Freedom guide you along the chosen path? 

● It does not let you give up, because you’ll always see your goals
● It counts how much money and time you saved
● Provides moral and motivational support
● Displays your progress on the widget

Do not lose your determination

Start by choosing one habit you want to get rid of. When you feel that a new way of life has become natural for you - you can proceed to the following changes. If you want dramatically change your life - do not hurry! Mentality and physiology take some time to rebuild. Your willpower is a limited resource, focus on one task. If you follow our recommendations, you will be satisfied with the results that will please you for many years!


Bonuses

Freedom has developed a system of rewards based on the accumulation of time and money saved for something that you have wanted but could not afford.

"Barbecue or barbeque is a cooking method, a style of food, and a name for a meal or gathering at which this style of food is cooked and served. Barbecue Grill Recipes free app brings you the collection of varieties of healthy and delicious bbq recipes. This app is completely free for all time. Party nights will not be complete without a fireplace and grilling. Bbq chicken consists of chicken parts or entire chickens that are barbecued, grilled or smoked.

The commonly used ingredients for barbecuing are meat items like chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp. Vegetables like cauliflower are also used for some grilling purposes. A barbecue can refer to the cooking method itself, the meat cooked this way, or to a type of social event featuring this type of cooking. Barbecuing is usually done outdoors by smoking meat over wood or charcoal. Restaurant barbecue may be cooked in large, specially-designed brick or metal ovens. Barbecuing techniques include smoking, roasting, and grilling. The technique for which it is named involves cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times (several hours). Grilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a fire for a few minutes.

Smoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts. Grilling is a form of cooking that involves a dry heat applied to the food, either from above or below. Grilling is an effective technique to cook meat or vegetables quickly since it involves a significant amount of radiant heat. There are many methods of grilling, which involve a type of braising or roasting. Grilling is one of the least common techniques used when cooking classic barbecue foods.

Anesoft ACLS Simulator will improve your resuscitation skills. This app is a simulator that enables you to rehearse cardiac arrest megacode management - anytime, anywhere. The simulated cases reinforce the American Heart Association 2015 ECC treatment guidelines. With regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation. 

You must act quickly in these simulations or the patient's condition will deteriorate.  Diagnose the ECG rhythm as the electrocardiogram waveform sweeps across the screen like on a real cardiac monitor.  Assess and control the patient's airway and ventilation, administer CPR, defibrillation and medications to bring the patient back from cardiac arrest.

This version of ACLS Simulator provides 12 case scenarios of cardiac arrest. There are three ventricular fibrillation cases of varying complexity. There are two pulseless ventricular tachycardia cases and two cases of ventricular tachycardia with a pulse. There is one case of asystole and one torsade. There is one case of narrow complex tachycardia, one case of wide complex tachycardia of unknown origin, and one case of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.

In addition to providing a graphical and dynamically changing simulation, the app provides a detailed record of your resuscitation, scores your performance, and provides detailed feedback on your management. Thus it is a complete learning environment.

With regular practice using ACLS Simulator you will always be ready to manage a real cardiac arrest."

"Anesoft Corporation suggests you use our latest app, ECG Rhythm and Pulse which combines the content of Rhythm Tutor, Rhythm Quiz and ACLS Simulator into one app. And its free! It also includes Spanish and Chinese language options and is optimized for Android phones and tablets.

'Anesoft ACLS Rhythm Tutor' is one of the series of apps from Anesoft Corporation to improve your ACLS resuscitation skills. This app will teach and reinforce an organized approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. 

The current version has improved graphics and performance.

Recognition of ECG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.

The app utilizes an organized four criteria approach to identify the rhythms. Then study the description of the rhythm to understand the electrophysiology. Use the same process to review all the ECG rhythms.

There are 80 ECG rhythms included in this app.

When you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should test yourself using the app 'Anesoft ACLS Rhythm Quiz'."

Set the sleep timer to 15, 30, or 60 minutes to turn off your screen after the specified time.

About GERD:
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux, or chronic heartburn, is a long term condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. 


Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatus hernia, and taking certain medicines. Medications involved include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication. It is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter (the junction between the stomach and the esophagus). Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.

Treatment is typically via lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, losing weight, avoiding certain foods, and stopping smoking. Medications include antacid, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.

remedies: chewing gum, licorice, aloe, slippery elm, apple cider vinegar

"When weightlifting, you want to focus on your workout. You don’t want to spend time calculating which weight plates you need to load onto your barbell. The RackMath barbell calculator is the simple solution to this problem. It calculates what weight plates you need to load onto your bar to achieve your desired weight.


Quick:
Stop doing the math in your head. The plate calculator will do the math for you. If you are into weightlifting or powerlifting and consistently perform heavy lifts like the squat, deadlift and bench press, then you won’t find a better weight plate calculator. Simply enter the weight you want to lift, and instantly you’ll know how to load your bar. It makes a perfect companion to weightlifting programs such as Starting Strength 5x5 or Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1.

Safe:
Don’t step into the squat rack with the wrong weight by accident. You can count on the RackMath barbell calculator to make sure you’re loading your bar correctly.

Customizable:
Other weightlifting plate calculators just assume you have certain plates and unlimited stock. We know that’s simply not true. This is why Rack Math is designed to let you set your own equipment inventory. Select pounds or kilograms and choose which weight plates (and how many) are available to you.

Fractional and non-standard weight plates:
Other weightlifting calculators do not include fractional plates or lesser used weight plate denominations. RackMath's inventory offers fractional plates as well as a large number of denominations.

RACKMATH PREMIUM* FEATURES

Custom bars:
With RackMath Premium, you get access to a variety of bars so you can move beyond the squat rack - use a dip belt, hex bar, leg press machine and EZ curl bars. Or create your own bar and set the weight to whatever you desire.

More plates:
Increase the plate maximum from 8 plates to 16 plates.

Custom plates:
Want Rack Math's plate inventory to match your own exactly? Go ahead and customize your plate colors. Have a plate with an unusual weight? You can add that too.

Collars:
If you're the type that wants to count every bit of weight, now you can by adding collar weights.

Percent table:
Perhaps our favorite feature, the percent table allows you to quickly change the weight by a percentage making it perfect for warm-up sets, pyramids and 5/3/1.

Reverse calculator:
Load up your weightlifting bar with whatever plates you want and then see how much weight you're about to lift.

Rep range calculator:
Calculate your theoretical lift weight across reps, from your one-rep max to 30.

No ads:
Take back your screen space with an ad-free experience.

"The benefit of short, high-intensity workouts is saving you time, money, and even doubling down. This is because of the unexpected effect on metabolism in the body which helps to speed up the process of weight loss to regain body shape.
- Short exercises at high intensity are the exercises usually take place in short time (range from 5 to 20 minutes) with continuous intensity.
- High-intensity short exercises such as HIIT are one of the fastest and most effective weight loss methods due to the assurance of burning the necessary calories in each exercise, speeding up the metabolism in the muscles. be.
- A 10 minute HIIT exercise is equivalent to your normal 30-45 minute workout. But perhaps, the biggest difference between HIIT and other exercises is that the fat burning effect lasts many hours later.
Great benefits of HIIT you need to know:
- High efficiency
- Great fat burning
- Increase endurance for the body
- Increasing physiology
- Reduce fat without losing muscle
- Increase metabolism
- Heart healthier
- High intensity exercise can improve oxygen consumption
The bottom line
High-intensity exercise is a very effective way of exercising and can help you burn more calories than other types of exercise.
Some of the calories burned during intense periods of time come from higher metabolism, which lasts for hours after exercise.
In general, high intensity exercise produces many of the same health benefits as other forms of exercise over a shorter period of time.
These benefits include lower body fat, heart rate and blood pressure. Intense exercise can also help lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity.
So, if you have a short time and want to be active, consider trying an intense workout."

"***Listen to your baby’s heartbeat using your headphones mic!***
Have a magical experience with your baby even before birth! Your baby can listen to your sounds on a daily basis. How about listening to your baby’s heartbeat and sounds as well? The app is a super awesome piece of technology utilizing the latest in audio engineering techniques to narrow down the heartbeat sound frequency and amplify this sound. 

What you want is a convenient method to check your baby’s heartbeat. Using the headphones mic gives you this convenience. You can listen with the left headphone and put the mic from the right headphone on your belly. 

-HOW DOES IT WORK?-
The app works by using the headphones mic to pick up on low frequency sounds, it blocks out high frequencies, then you can amplify these low frequencies to pick up the heartbeat sound. The app is built to pick up on human (fetal or adult) heartbeats. Once you find the heartbeat live, you can use the recorder to record and share the heartbeat. 

-FEATURES-

HIGH PASS FILTER – The high pass filter will only let frequencies in higher than what you adjust the knob at.
LOW PASS FILTER - The low pass filter will only let frequencies in lower than what you adjust the knob at.

AMPLIFIER
Turn up GAIN in the app to amplify the sounds that you are picking up. 

RECORD AND SHARE
Record and process the heartbeat and then share it with your family and friends!

TUTORIAL
There is a tutorial in the app should you need to refer to it. 

HOW DO I USE IT?
1) SILENCE: You need complete silence in order to find and hear the heartbeat. 
2) POSITION: Your baby needs to be in the right position to be able to pick up a heartbeat. You might have to wait until your baby moves. 
3) DETECTION: Since everyone’s body is different, you will have to adjust the app controls carefully, and as needed. The best advice I can give is to be sure you have plenty of time. 
4) AIRPLANE MODE: As an extra precaution, put your phone in Airplane Mode before using the app. 

NOTE 1: This is simply an app for bonding purposes with your baby and is not a medical device. You must be around 20 weeks + pregnant to be able to hear your baby’s heartbeat. Before 20 weeks the baby’s heart is too small to detect a heartbeat. It is ideal to use the app after 30+ weeks of gestation.
CAUTION: It is best to use the app on an empty stomach (you don’t want to pick up on stomach noises).

NOTE 2:
You must use iPhone OEM headphones  (the headphones that came in your iPhone box upon purchase) in order to use this app. This is what the app was engineered for. Otherwise, you will simply get bad feedback (really annoying sounds), you don’t want that!

"Why the sound of water helps you sleep: Study reveals how non-threatening noises are blocked out by the brain?

Rolling ocean waves and the low rumble of a distant thunder storm are known to put a person to sleep, but have you ever wondered why these sounds are so calming?
In part, it is because the brain interprets these sounds as 'non-threats,' according to an associate professor from Pennsylvania State University, and it can use them to block out other, more alarming noises.
While a shrill sound can jolt you out of a deep sleep, the pattering of raindrops in a quiet forest will exist peacefully in the background.

We are connected to it. Hawaii Thunder and lightning sends powerful booms shaking at times our bodies, homes and the like. Energy. Its dull roaring howl, reminders rolling in the distance, that what we're apart of then is nothing short of omnipotence. Crackling and fearless. I believe thunder can teach us patience if we listen. It takes me away from worldly desires. It seems to naturally sooth my soul. This question make me imagine my ancestors, our ancestors, Listening intently to the sounds of the Universe. Thunder is part of the very core processes of life, here on land. Thunder and lightning is part of that which binds my soul to this place. It can scare others too, when we are young its frightening and loud, but as we get older it sings differently to our being. Coupled with the rain, Sleep Thunder Sound speaks volumes and allows the mind to focus if needed. I believe thunder can be a reminder of who, what and where we are, or have been, happy, sad, calm, furious. Beautiful relaxing music featuring violin music, harp music, flute music, piano music and ethereal vocals

Onweer is een bui of cumulonimbus die gepaard gaat met elektrische ontladingen. Check out Meditate with Natural Rainfall by Rain Sounds Of Nature

Free thunder sound effects to download and use in your projects. Lots of thunder sounds and rumbles and big cracks of thunder.

You can adjust the volume of rain, thunders and music individually to find the ideal combination and so encourage a deep relaxation of the mind.

"Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.

Stretching Exercises: How to Get Flexible Quickly and Safely
Most people wish they were more flexible but don’t do anything about it, because most flexibility training feels like a weird form of torture. In this app we'll show you simple steps to rapidly improve your flexibility without having to stretch for hours every day.

We created multiple workout programs with stretches for:
- Full Body
- Lower Body: leg, hip, glute and lower back stretches
- Upper Body: upper back, chest, shoulder and neck stretches
- Yoga Stretches to Increase Flexibility

Beginners can do all the stretching exercises we provide.

It's true that stretching is neither glamorous nor hardcore, and it probably won't give you the same rush that a run or HIIT class will.
Luckily, improving your flexibility and mobility isn't hard. It just takes a little time. Try adding the stretches for flexibility your workout routine to help relieve muscle tension and increase mobility—so that you can move through both the gym and life more freely.

Stretching exercises and workout stretches routines for better flexibility.
Stretching is essential for improving flexibility, which is an important component of overall fitness, along with mobility, strength, power, and endurance.

At Home Stretching Routine Exercises
We added multiple at-home stretches that instantly make you feel less achy.
If they’re not already a part of your workout regimen, read on to learn which stretching exercises are best for warming up, cooling down, and improving overall fitness. Stretching is an important part of fitness: It can improve your range of motion, increase circulation, and calm your mind—which may help fend off injuries and illness, as well as bring on a better night’s sleep.

Stretches for back pain relief
When you're dealing with the aches and oftentimes debilitating soreness of lower-back pain, there's a good chance all you want to do is stay in bed. Yet research found that any kind of exercise—whether it's core strengthening, aerobic exercise, or stretching—is the best way to ease pain and reduce the risk of another back pain attack.

The nice thing about gentle stretching is that it's feasible to do when you're in pain—and often provides the fastest relief.

Work these simple moves into your routine to loosen muscles and maintain flexibility.
We offer the best stretches for warm-up, cooldown, and everyday flexibility."

You can calculate your BMI with both the metric system (kg/m2) and the imperial system (lbs/inches2). 

Below the BMI calculator is a chart presented by the World Health Organization (WHO), showing whether you’re underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 17.5 kg/m2), normal weight (17.5 to 24), overweight (24 to 29), and obese (over 29).

As well as that, it will also tell you what is considered the right weight for your height, so you can lose/gain weight and improve your health massively.

To help you with this, we have implemented a database with many types of food.

You can easily find out the nutritional value (proteins, carbs, fat, and calories) of your favourite meal. 

We have also prepared some interesting facts about food and diets for you.

The table of nutritional values and the facts can help you make your own diet, and help you achieve your goal weight."
" Think what you need to survive is really just to survive. Food? Air? Social networks? 
 Let's focus on water. Water is of great importance to all living things; in some organisms, up to  90%  their body weight comes from water. Up to  60%  of the adult human body - water.

According to H.H. Mitchell, Journal of Biological Chemistry 158,  brain and heart  consist of  73% water , and  lungs  - about  83%  water.  Skin  contains  64%  water,  muscles and kidneys  -  79% , even  bones  contain large amounts of water:  31% .

Every day, people must consume a certain amount of water in order to live. Of course, this depends on age and gender, as well as where someone lives. Typically, an adult  man  needs  about 102 fl.oz  of water per day, while an adult  woman  needs about  75 fl.oz  per day. All the water that a person needs should not come from drinking liquids, since part of this water is contained in the food we eat.

"An app to introduce zazen and meditation.
I wanted to share my experience at a Zen monastery, so I made this app. The ascetic practice was not a beautiful world like the image people have in the world, but it was very human and I was on the edge of my seat everyday. In the midst of these days, I could not usually concentrate on zazen due to fatigue and pain in my legs, but suddenly there was a time when I could sit very calmly.
I can't describe it well, but I could feel the breathing of my fellow zazen practitioners, the sounds of nature, the space, and the surroundings.
It was just a simple case of sitting well. Oh, I'm sitting. That's what I thought.

Life at such a Zen temple was filled with sound. The sounds were different from the hustle and bustle of the city. At Zen temples, time is told by sound. The sounds of waking up, gathering, eating, chanting, sleeping, etc. are all different. Bells, sutra reading, wooden fish, woodblocks, sweeping, the list goes on and on. Even now that I have finished my practice, they still resonate in my mind.

Zen meditation does not give you any special ability, it does not make you fly, it does not increase your skills. A Zen master once said that there is a ""one true man of no rank"" in him. This is to realize that you are your original self, without any title, without anything, and that you are your original self. There is a Zen master who said, ""Zazen is only ease. One Zen master once said, ""Zazen is just ease,"" meaning to put down what you carry on your back, become yourself, and just sit.

I tried to create a simple application, away from difficult Chinese sentences and religious rituals.
That breath, that sound, that rhythm, that tempo, that feeling, that world.
I hope that the essence can be reproduced and conveyed in the app, even if only a little.

Sincerely yours




Features of the app
Many free sound sources
A meditation timer that allows you to freely combine sounds.
A guide to zazen, and an explanation of zazen.

"How to Clean Your Penis
Irritation, infections, and unpleasant odors are just a few of the health conditions that can occur if you fail to maintain good hygiene habits
 for your penis and sexual health. Cleaning your penis affair can also help reduce your chances of contracting a sexually transmitted 
Hygiene practices will be slightly different between circumcised and uncircumcised men, but both are quite similar. 
Learning how to properly clean your penis can help you maintain optimal health and cleanliness.

How to Keep Your Private Parts Clean
Keeping your private parts clean and well-groomed gives you a fresh feeling that will please both you and your partner.
 Here are some tips for men and women on how to spruce up.

How to Pull Your Foreskin Back Without Pain
The foreskin covers and protects the sensitive head of an uncircumcised penis, and most teens and adults find it easy and painless to pull back.
 However, if trying to pull your foreskin back causes severe pain or bleeding, if there's redness or swelling beneath it,
 and especially if it gets stuck in a retracted position, call your doctor right away. Otherwise, there are foreskin loosening techniques
 you can use to address this problem. In any case, you should always keep your foreskin clean and take special precautions with a child's foreskin.

If you just had contact with another person's genitals, you may be at risk for contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI), 
also sometimes called a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Male and female condoms can help reduce the risk of STI transmission,
 but are not foolproof methods. STI symptoms are not always obvious, but there are some things to be on the lookout for.
How to Treat a Penile Yeast Infection
While it is more common for women to get yeast infections, it is also possible for men to contract a genital yeast infection, 
usually after having unprotected affairs  with a partner who is already infected. The infection usually appears on the skin outside the penis. 
Penile yeast infections affect men who are uncircumcised more than those who are circumcised.

Maintaining good hygiene and care of your genitals reduces the chances of developing problems like skin irritations and some common infections. 
Often it is assumed that men know the steps to good penis care, but it never hurts to remind yourself of the best practices.
The same basic principles apply whether you have a foreskin or have been circumcised.

If you chose to have your son circumcised, the procedure probably has been performed in the hospital on the second or third day after birth, but may be done after discharge during the first week of life. Ritual circumcisions for religious reasons are usually performed in the second week of life. Afterward, a light dressing such as gauze with petroleum jelly will have been placed over the head of the penis.

What to expect:
The tip of the penis may look quite red for the first few days, and you may notice a yellow secretion. Both indicate that the area is healing normally. The redness and secretion should disappear gradually within a week.

In an uncircumcised boy, the foreskin will begin to separate from the glans. This is called foreskin retraction. This happens naturally while the boy is a baby. Foreskin retraction may happen right after birth. Or it may take several years. Most foreskins can be fully retracted by the time a young man is 18 years old. Retracting or pulling back the foreskin from the tip of the penis should not be forced. If the foreskin is forced to retract, it may cause bleeding and mild pain.

What affects penis health?
Many different things can affect penis health. And by “penis health,” we mean:
your ability to urinate comfortably
your ability to get or maintain an erection
your fertility
Penis health also includes avoiding certain health conditions, such as penile cancer and STIs."

"Some people like to work in the cafe, but not in quiet library - some studies show that coffee shop environment will be more conducive to the sound focus, enhance creativity at work, this environment can be considered a kind of sound. "" white noise. ""

If you like listening to the rain, do not miss this application.

In addition to sound variety, also supports a variety of sound reverberation, and other custom scene.

Writing, running, travel time can be opened to listen!

It contains a variety of natural ambient sound.

Imitate the sounds of nature - this is the white noise (white noise), improve concentration, relaxation, fine.

Refers to white noise in a wide frequency range, the energy of each frequency band included in the noise and other noise equivalent bandwidth. Usually physically translate it into white noise (white noise). White noise or white noise is a constant power spectral density of random signals or random process. In other words, the signal power in each band is the same, since the white light is a mixture of various frequencies (colors) of monochromatic light, so that this signal has the nature of a flat power spectrum is called ""white"", this signal has therefore been called white noise. Noise signal relative, other do not have this property are called colored noise. Ideal white noise has infinite bandwidth, so its energy is infinite, which is impossible in the real world exists. In fact, we often limited bandwidth of the signal level regarded as white noise, because it makes us more convenient in mathematical analysis. However, the white noise in the mathematical treatment is more convenient, so it is a powerful tool for system analysis. In general, as long as the spectral width of a noise process has the effect that it is much larger than the bandwidth of the system, and its spectral density can basically be considered as a constant in the bandwidth, you can use it as white noise to deal with. For example, thermal noise and shot noise over a wide frequency range with a uniform power spectral density can usually think they are white noise. When you need to concentrate on work, there is always a complex and surrounding sound, you can use these two sounds to be obscured. In general, under normal circumstances you can use the white noise, pink noise is specifically for voice masking material. Pink noise has been known frequency is inversely proportional to (1 / f) noise, because its energy is inversely proportional to the frequency distribution, or every octave (Octave) the energy recession 3dB.

One application is the white noise of architectural acoustics, in order to weaken the internal space distracting and do not want the noise (such as conversation human) appears, use continuous low-intensity noise as background sound. Some sirens of emergency vehicles also use white noise as white noise to pass through cities such as background noise and traffic noise does not cause reflections, it is easier to attract attention. In electronic music also applied white noise, which is directly or as the input signal of the filter to produce other types of noise signals, especially in audio synthesis, often like cymbals for reproducing a high frequency domain so that percussion noise components. White noise is used to generate the impulse response. In order to ensure a balanced effect Venue concerts or other performances, it issued a white noise or pink noise from the PA system instantly, and in a different place to monitor the noise signal, so that engineers can effect a building acoustics can automatically enlarge or cut certain frequencies, which can be adjusted to give effect overall balance a balanced harmony. White noise can be used for frequency response of the filter amplifier or electronic test, sometimes it is used with a flat response microphone or automatic equalizer."

"In the faster-is-better world we live in, carving out 30 to 45 minutes a day for a good workout can seem like a major challenge—and that can totally mess with your quest for a strong core. Enter: the 7-minute workout.

Impressive features of this ABS Workout
- 7 minute workout
- Supported by science
- No equipment
- 3 Levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced

This strategic, super-effective form of high-intensity circuit training is supported by science. To complement the original—and give you even more 7-minute options, we asked Yusuf Jeffers, certified personal trainer and Head Coach at Tone House in New York City, to create a companion abs workout that requires only your body weight.

A killer combo of core-strengthening moves and cardio, this circuit’s designed to “attack” not only your abs and obliques, but also the muscles in your back, pelvic floor, and even your shoulders, says Jeffers. And, truth be told, it beats doing hundreds of crunches. “If you’re training for a sport—or just for everyday life—you usually don’t use any one muscle in isolation,” he says. “This correlates closer to actual, functional movements.” And that’s a good thing: While crunches certainly strengthen your abs, the body benefits more—by torching more calories, for example—from movements that recruit more than one muscle group.

Though it’s important to remember that high-intensity interval training isn’t meant to be a daily workout, it’s a great tool to have in your exercise arsenal, particularly on days when all you’ve got is 7 minutes to spare.

How to use this list: Perform each move below for 30 seconds, resting 5 to 10 seconds in-between. With this circuit, the goal is to go big or go home—meaning, working at the highest possible intensity for as many reps as you can without sacrificing form. Expect to perform anywhere from 15 to 20 reps, though remember that quality always tops quantity, says Jeffers. (So don’t stress if your rep count is on the lower end the first couple of times you try this—there’s always time to improve.) If time allows, you can repeat the circuit 2 to 3 times."

"Relax & Sleep with ""Various artists"" - Classical by meditone

This app is an app that is derived from all the music therapy apps developed by digiart, Inc., and is specific to classical music. 
---------------------------------------------------------

""Based on meditone Core Technology,"" which is a culmination of various technologies related to music that impacts the human mind and body, 
classical music, the benefits of which has been recognized in French musical therapy circles, is rearranged based on ""tone,"" ""rhythm,"" and ""acoustics"" into tones that have a strong psychological impact. 
---------------------------------------------------------
[Tone] 
Employing sounds created using special acoustic boards created from select rare metals, of which only small amounts are excavated around the world, that produce particularly high α waves 
to produce tones that permeate the listeners mind and body. 
---------------------------------------------------------
[Rhythm] 
Tones are layered primarily to achieve an effect on the nervous system. Research has returned results showing that such tones have improving and easing effects on 
symptoms related to autonomic nervous system disorders and PMS (premenstrual syndrome). 
---------------------------------------------------------
[Acoustics]
By combining this regenerated classical music with ""Harmonized Binaural Tones"" further evolved using ""Binaural Beats,"" the effects of which were highly praised 
in ""SLEEP by meditone"" as well, the app achieves a relaxing effect that is equivalent to or greater than listening to classical music on a top class player. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, classical music has a long history and background of achieving various psychological benefits. 
Each tone includes an explanation regarding the specific composer and why each original piece produces that type of effect. 
This app can be used as a guide to classical music for people are hesitant about classical music and as an educational item for small children. 

The beautiful Mont Saint-Michel is the entryway to comforting tones. 
*The effects of ""Harmonized Binaural Tones"" improve dramatically when listened to with headphones. Try based on the intended us of the app and the usage environment."

"The full-body workout is simple in concept–you train your entire body in one workout.

Our Full Body workout routine is a total body training for beginners at home.
In a full-body routine, you train every major muscle in your body, like your chest, back, arms, hamstrings, and abs, in each workout.
Full Body workouts are the best training programs for women and men.
They incorporate exercises that engage many of those muscle groups in one movement, like squats, deadlifts, and overhead presses, all of which are also called compound movements. Compound movements demand a lot of energy and burn more calories, but they also beat up your muscles and typically require you to rest more between each set of exercise and whole workouts.

The upside is that when you work out the same muscle groups by doing the same or similar exercises multiple times each week, you improve your overall body strength, rather than just in one area.
Circuit training, metabolic intervals, and compound lifts engage more muscle groups, skyrocket your heart rate, and burn more calories. Hitting your full body all the time from a conditioning aspect is great; it’s the model CrossFit follows.

Total-Body Workout Benefits for beginners and advanced:
1. Burn More Calories in Less Time
2. Build More Muscle
3. Increase Strength
4. Maximize Workout Efficiency
5. Have Greater Flexibility

We created workout programs with the best bodyweight exercises for burning fat at home.
When it comes to getting shredded, sometimes the best thing you can do is set down the heavy iron and go for all-out, bare-bones bodyweight exercises. Exercises that help you tone up your entire body as it works your lower body, upper body and your core.

If you want to build muscle mass, there are hundreds of different training programs you could choose from to help you achieve that goal. And although many of them will give you decent results, at least for a while, if you want to build the maximum amount of muscle in the shortest possible time, you really can’t beat a full-body workout routine.

This is especially true for those who are just starting out. So if you are a beginner in your first year or two of training, or you haven't had much in the way of results from your efforts so far, our full body workout programs can help you out."

"Yoga Flexibility for Beginners


Flexibility exercises are a key part of maintaining your health and avoiding injury, especially as you age. The stretching you do in yoga is a great way to improve your flexibility. It's a commonly held misconception that you have to already be flexible to do yoga. In fact, the opposite is true: doing yoga regularly is a sure way to become more flexible. If that's your goal, here are some poses that target major muscles groups that tend to get tight from sitting for long periods or even from other types of exercise, like running. Staying in the poses for several minutes is the way to get a good stretch. Don't expect overnight changes, however. 

This beginner level yoga for flexibility is designed to stretch a little bit of everything with basic poses. 
For best results, do these stretches daily. The following poses are intended to give you some options to fit your current level of flexibility."

"Sometimes in yoga's recent history, a gender shift occurred. Yoga, which traditionally had been practiced only by men, began to be dominated by women. Today, an average yoga class will have more female than male students. In the United States, your yoga teacher is also more likely to be female, although there are a great number of prominent male teachers, including the founders of some of yoga's most popular contemporary styles.


A lot of men worry that yoga is not appropriate for them because they aren't naturally flexible. But flexibility is not a prerequisite for yoga. The fact is, men have a lot to gain from yoga and are as welcomed as women in almost every situation. If you are a man who has been wanting to try yoga, here's the information you need to make that leap.

"If you find you have a problem with constantly watering eyes, it’s usually because of excessive tear production, or poor tear drainage.
Our bodies produce tears to keep our eyes lubricated, and to help remove any foreign bodies. But when the body produces too many tears, or tear drainage is affected, the result is excessively watery eyes. While not necessarily harmful, watery eyes can be troublesome and irritating. Thankfully, they can usually be treated quickly and effectively.
In this app you will find all the tips and remedies you need.

"How Kickboxing Can Change Your Body and Your Life?
Fitness kickboxing is a group fitness class that combines martial arts techniques with fast-paced cardio. This high-energy workout challenges the beginner and elite athlete alike.
Build stamina, improve self defence, coordination and flexibility, and burn calories as you build lean muscle with this fun and challenging workout.
Fitness kickboxing is a good fitness choice for those looking to burn calories for weight loss, or to improve stamina and heart health. People who become easily bored with stationary cardio equipment like treadmills and stair steppers will enjoy the fast pace and new movements in a cardio kickboxing class.
If you perform the punches with precision and power, you will strengthen your upper body and eventually see more muscle definition. The kicks will strengthen your legs. And the knee techniques (a strike in which you thrust your bent knee upward) will firm your abdominal muscles; in fact, all of the moves, when done correctly, will make your torso into a solid base that lets you do day-to-day tasks more easily.

FEATURES: 
- Training Program are grouped by difficulty level : Beginnger, Intermediate and Advanced.
- All kickboxing techniques are designed by 3D modeling with HD videos.
- Only 10 to 30 minutes total body workout per day.

"🎯Perfect vision for everyone - that's the goal of the application.
⚡Our mission is to help you recover your eyesight quickly by means of Bates, Zhdanov method.⚡
This method mostly based on the exercises for eyes.
🎯An excellent Eagle vision FOREVER. 
🎯No glasses and lenses anymore! 100% vision without laser correction.
👉THE APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:
In this application you will find everything you need to recover your eyesight up to 100%! We offer the effective exercises, various recommendations, tips to recover one's eyesight up to 100%. These exercises, tips, etc. based primarily on the method of William Bates, and his successor, VG Zhdanov.
Techniques authors, Professor Zhdanov and Bates, are sure that eyesight can be recovered up 100% or even more for the majority of people. 
The application contains a description of the method, exercises for eyes, tips, recommendations, and contraindications.
'List of exercises "" contains complete list of the exercises to train one's eyes.
'Tips and recommendations' contains general tips, pieces of advice for the full vision recovery, e.g. (right light, work with computer, healthy lifestyle, diet, food that is beneficial for eyes, etc.)
'Complex' offers you several sets of comprehensive measures to restore one's eyesight and it consists of the most effective exercises for the eyes, various recommendations as well as medicines.
👉ABOUT METHOD.
Taking into consideration the fact how actively we are living nowadays, and experiencing eyestrain very often, interest in the subject of eyesight recovery and improvement without medical surgery is enormous. Constant reading books, newspapers and news using electronic devices, hours spent in front of the computer screen or TV, stress - all these things are bad for one's eyesight. Therefore, a course or technique which is created by Bates and his successor Professor Zhdanov, 'Return one's eyesight' will be useful for almost every person.
Bates has created a unique system of exercises to recover eyesight. The healing effect is achieved by relaxation and training certain eye muscles. Although the theory of Bates and a description of their exercise have been translated into several language, and even published in some books, the method of Bates is still not widespread. Perhaps, the reason of it is that the method is not profitable for companies engaged in the production and sale of glasses and lenses, taking into consideration the scale of the market it is not so difficult to allocate some money to prevent spreading of this information.
👉 Ophthalmologist point of view regarding Bates method.
There has been increased attention to the method of Bates recent years. This method promises to improve eyesight. The technique promises ideal vision. Information about Bates method is written and distributed in the Internet by non-professionals, which causes confusion and misunderstanding. It results in a negative attitude towards this eyesight recovery method among professionals who often do not know even the gist of it. Is this attitude justified? Let's take a look at the Bates technique from the ophthalmologist point of view and without prejudice.
The method of Bates is aimed to improve visual acuity through training the eye muscles. Eye muscles can be trained in similar way as other muscles - by doing exercises. It is important gradual and systematic approach when it comes to doing eye exercises. If an untrained person coming to the gym and starts with maximum weights it causes high risk and no effective results. The same principle is applied when it comes to all exercises for eyes.
Bates method effectively helps to recover eyesight from low degree of myopia/hyperopia, and even medium/high degree, but it takes more time and regular practice."

A river is a natural watercourse,[ usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea, or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, run, tributary and rill. There are no official definitions for generic terms, such as river, as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream may be defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ""burn"" in Scotland and northeast England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, because of vagueness in the language."

"Low-calorie recipes app is the best place where you can find the best fitness recipes. For a successful weight loss goal, you need to eat foods having low calories.

Most diets involve reducing calories in some way or another. Some introduce foods that fill you up faster but contain fewer calories, such as fruits and vegetables in place of processed foods. Other diets restrict your options, and eating the same food sources becomes repetitive and less interesting, so you consume fewer items. Still, other diets combine both strategies, such as diets recommending a low-calorie food such as a tomato, or a special shake that you make, for most or all of your meals. But new research shows that low-calorie diets can help with surprisingly more than your weight.

A low-calorie diet is one that restricts your intake to 1200 to 1600 calories per day for men, and 1000 to 1200 calories per day for women. Some people go on a very low-calorie diet for rapid weight loss, often consuming only 800 calories a day. This type of diet usually includes special foods such as shakes and soups to replace meals and for added vitamins. Very low-calorie diets can help a person achieve a weight loss of up to 3 to 5 pounds per week.

For weight loss, most people should consider a low-fat diet rather than a very low-calorie diet. Less extreme diets are easier to follow. They interrupt normal daily activities less and are less risky if you're over 50 or have other health problems. Also, gallstones have been reported in people who go on very-low-calorie diets. Keep in mind that most diets only work when you make healthy lifestyle choices at the same time. Including increasing daily exercise and reducing your sedentary time throughout the day.

Hypnosis against anxiety, Stress relief and big depression. Deep sleep hypnosis for depression anxiety self confidence emotional healing. Hypnosis is a state of human consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion. The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis.

Mindfulness meditation is frequently studied, a Buddhist meditation approach found in Zen and Vipassana.


A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear."

"Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker allows you to track and chart all of your most important body measurements including weight, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, body fat percentage and Body Mass Index (BMI). In addition to being a weight loss tracker this app allows you to  track any custom body measurements you can think of (shoulders, skeletal muscle %, body water % etc.) on your mobile device.  What’s more, you can instantly chart the changes in your body stats over time, and your data is automatically synced to the cloud if you login.  

The app also includes a built-in body fat calculator and will calculate lean body mass, body fat mass, waist-to-hips ratio and daily caloric needs as well.  

The app also integrates with Google Fit allowing you to import from or export weight measurements to Google Fit. The app will also import nutritional information from allowing you to see Calories Consumed, Calories Expended and Net Calories plotted against any measurement or calculated value.  This integration requires an in-app purchase. 

When using a weight loss tracker, it is important to monitor not only what and how much you eat, but also your weight and other indicators of health such as body fat percentage, waist, hips etc. Since body weight can fluctuate up to 5 lbs (2.3kg) per day, it is important to weigh yourself on a regular basis and at a consistent time every day.  This way, by looking at your body measurement chart, you will be able to assess your weight loss trend over time.  Some digital scales provide an estimate of body fat percentage, which you can save within Body Measurement Tracker to determine whether your weight loss is a result of a desirable loss in body fat.  Alternatively, by measuring waist, neck, height and hip circumferences the app’s body fat calculator will automatically calculate body fat and lean mass percentages and chart them over time.  If your lean body mass is calculated successfully, the app will also estimate your daily caloric need based on your stated activity level and sex.  

Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker is customizable allowing you to track any body measurement you can think of and ignore the ones you are not interested in.  The following measurements are included by default:

- Waist
- Weight
- Hips
- Body Fat Percentage
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Chest
- Upper Arms (biceps and triceps)
- Lower Arms (forearms)
- Upper Legs (thighs/quads and hamstrings)
- Lower Legs (calves)
- Height

Body Progress Photos
Keep tabs of how you look over time by taking an unlimited number of pictures of your body.  Just like the rest of your data, your body progress photos are automatically synced so they can be viewed across devices, so you never have to worry about losing them ever again.

Calculated Body Stats
The following body stats are automatically calculated, if you have recorded the required measurements:
Body Mass Index (BMI) - The BMI is the ratio of body mass to the square of the body height and is a very commonly used index to categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.  Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke and more.  
Body Fat Percentage - The body fat percentage is the total weight of fat divided by the total body weight.  It can be estimated many ways, but since the body fat calculator relies on the measurement of height, weight and body circumferences, the Navy Method for body fat estimation is used.  This method relies on waist, neck and height measurements for males and waist, neck, height and hip measurements for females.  
Waist to Hips Ratio - The waist to hips ratio is a useful indicator of overall health.

"It can be a little hard for some of us to believe, but classical music could do your baby a lot of good. There are experts who believe that listening to classical can make a baby healthier, smarter, and happier.
The idea that classic music can help babies is nothing new, but in recent decades, a great deal of evidence supporting the notion has been accumulated. Intriguingly, there is now quite a bit of data that indicates classic tunes can enhance a baby’s physical development and health in addition to intelligence.

Why Should I Choose Classical Music?

1. Positive on Physical Health
2. Good for Language Development
3. Able to Uplift Their Mood

Some Criteria You Should Know
There are many different kinds of classical music out there, some of which are not appropriate for children. Wagnerian opera, for example, is probably too loud and violent for children. Parents should be careful because some classical compositions could overstimulate or bore children.
Experts like those at the American Music Therapy Association have compiled a list of attributes that classical songs for children should possess. These characteristics include:
A steady beat. Songs with a lot of vocals will not help babies because they lack a beat.
A steady and regular rhythm. Music without a steady rhythm can stimulate children, but it will not relax them nor will it encourage the development of memory skills.
The song should be fairly simple and easy to understand. Orchestral works and operas are often simply too complex for young children to grasp. In particular, look for works with no vocals that utilize only one or two instruments."

Benefits of Push Ups

Increase Functional Strength via Full Body Activation 
Major muscle groups, such as your biceps, core muscles, triceps, anterior deltoids and lower body muscle groups are activated to support your body while stabilizing your movements. 

Muscle Stretching for Health and Vitality 
One of the most underrated benefits of doing push ups is the stretch it provides to your biceps and back muscles. As you lower yourself to the floor, your back muscles are effectively stretched, and as you push yourself to the starting position your biceps obtain a full stretch.

Enhance Your Cardiovascular System 
Push Ups are classified as a compound exercise as it calls upon multiple muscle groups. When you simultaneously engage large muscle groups, your heart must work harder to deliver oxygen-rich blood to muscle tissue. Ultimately, this activity results in an effective cardiovascular exercise, which supports heart health and promotes the reduction of stored body fat.

Increase Whole Body Muscle Definition
Throughout the movements of a push up, you recruit a wide array of primary and stabilizing muscles. The more muscle mass that’s utilized in a strength training exercise, the greater the production and release of a specialized hormone known as HGH, or human growth hormone. By calling upon such a wide array of muscles, the production of HGH is triggered, which ultimately results in muscle hypertrophy – or muscle growth. To maximize push up benefits, you must incorporate this exercise into your regular strength training program.

Just do 3 workouts per week and get a perfect body you've always wanted!"

"The Secret of Weight (TSOW) is a simple and practical calorie counter based on photos. With this fun and playful application, you can either maintain your weight, slim down or even gain weight; it’s all up to you!

We all have heard about calories before! Why use this app then? Is it easy to navigate? How do we add up our calories?

The Secret of Weight explains everything! The number of calories you can spend each day. What happens if you go over your budget? How to rectify when you overindulge... Most importantly, the application simplifies calorie counting for you, as you can select what you had to eat using food pictures in the app!

How does it work?

- There is a daily calorie budget which you can spend without getting fat. You can spend your money as you wish! You can eat all kinds of food and as long as you stay within your budget you will not gain weight! This is THE big Secret of Weight.

Okay, but how does it all work?

- Throughout the day, you can add the food you're having and select the portions you're having by using the food pictures. A small gauge shows you how many calories you have left to spend for that given day.
- If you eat more than the budget, you’ll gain weight: a chart shows you, in real time, how many grams you gain when you overindulge.
- If you eat less than your estimated budget, you’ll lose weight: a chart indicates, in real time, how many grams you have lost.

The new thing about this concept is to make you see how losing weight does not necessarily mean banishing forbidden foods from your diet! You will also precisely learn how many calories you will need to eat or not in order to gain or lose a kilo.

Contents:
- Caloric gauge and dashboard.
- Food catalogue:
    1661 photos of food
    1934 foods represented
- Possibility to add food to your cart, using or not photos.
- Possible to save your own recipes with or without photos.
- You can add food items to ""Favorites"".
- Food shopping (it is possible to check your basket for the last 10 days).
- Customized Settings.
- Help topics.
- Small character as your coach (""Flo"").
- Possibility to customize the dashboard by changing the color of the gauge and the character (by pressing one or the other).

No fees, no additional paying options. The only product that we present is the book, The Secret of Weight (available on Amazon), which, if you buy it, will tell you more about the Secret of Weight method!

We invite you to test this wonderful tool for yourself!

The application’s limited options help us focus on the simple, basic things. You will quickly get to know all the options (but it will still take a few minutes to understand the basic idea). With the help of explanatory texts, you will catch on and before you know it you'll start managing your weight all on your own! Keep it simple, think simple, and lose weight easily!"

After this training you will look good like never before;)

✔ 11 workout routines for firm legs, hips and buttocks

You were waiting and finally you've got it! Your personal coach to form the sporty legs, buttocks and thighs now available on your phone and tablet. 
Lots of women would like to have firm and slim legs, thighs, and buttocks, but they avoid leg exercise because they don't want their leg size to get bigger; they are also afraid of having bigger muscle mass. It is true that there are many leg exercises that result in bigger muscle mass, but there are other exercises that will simply improve your figure and firm the body. 

★ These exercises help to burn fat and create firm legs and buttocks. ★

When you train your legs and buttocks, you improve the quantity of muscle fiber, it burns calories naturally. Besides, the more muscles you have, the more energy is needed to maintain them, so your body has to burn more calories. Leg muscles, especially the thigh muscles, are very big muscle groups. When you train such big muscles, you cause metabolic changes - you burn many more calories because you are using big muscles.

Women don't develop muscles as easily as men do because they don't have enough testosterone to do so. That is why there is no need to worry about leg size getting bigger - it really pays to train your legs and buttocks.

Especially for women, we have compiled a list of exercises for the legs, thighs, and buttocks."

Fun Fact #1
What is ketogenic Diet or Keto Diet.
The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb diet plan that was originally designed in the 1920s for patients with epilepsy by researchers working at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Researchers found that fasting — avoiding consumption of all foods for a brief period of time, including those that provide carbohydrates — helped reduce the amount of seizures patients suffered, in addition to having other positive effects on body fat, blood sugar, cholesterol and hunger levels.

Fun Fact #2
What is Ketosis?
Ketosis is the result of following the standard ketogenic diet, which is why it’s also sometimes called “the ketosis diet.” Ketosis takes place when glucose from carbohydrate foods (like grains, all sources of sugar or fruit, for example) is drastically reduced, which forces the body to find an alternative fuel source: fat. Although dietary fat (especially saturated fat) often gets a bad name, provoking fear of weight gain and heart disease, it’s also your body’s second preferred source of energy when carbohydrates are not easily accessible.

"What is high blood pressure?

High blood pressure is a common cardiovascular disorder. It concerns more than 10 million people in France. Usually, blood pressure - blood pressure in the arteries - is about 12/8 cmHg (centimeters of mercury). The first number corresponds to the blood pressure measured during the relaxation phase of the heart (diastolic pressure). The second digit, to the measurement taken during the contraction phase of the heart (systolic pressure).

Blood pressure varies during the day. In a situation of stress or intense emotion, it rises naturally. When the blood pressure remains high, beyond 14/9 cmHg, we talk about high blood pressure.
Untreated hypertension can cause many complications: stroke, heart attack, heart failure or renal failure, retinopathy, arteriosclerosis, erectile dysfunction ...

In 90% of cases, we do not know the cause of hypertension. But we know that age, heredity, lack of exercise or overweight ... More rarely, hypertension is secondary to disease or taking medication (anti-inflammatory, bronchodilators ...).

During pregnancy, high blood pressure may also appear. This is called ""gravidic"" hypertension. This hypertension must be monitored because it can cause problems in childbirth.

"Height is determined 70% by genetics and 30% by environmental factors like nutrition, health, and exercise. There are many other variables, so the science of height prediction is not 100% accurate. However, there are two methods that can give you a good estimate as listed below. This app implements both the Mid-parent method and the more accurate Khamis-Roche method. Tracking your child's height with this app can show you if your child is developing normally. 

• Mid-parent Method
This method can be used if your child is less than 4 years old. Derived from a 1948 article by Horace Gray in the journal of Child Development, it is still widely used today. The margin of error is +/- 4 inches or 10.16 cm. This is a simple formula where the adult the adult height is calculated from the parents' height and the child's gender.

• Khamis-Roche Method
This method can be used for children 4 to 17 years old. Developed by Dr. Khamis and Dr. Roche, this method is around 90% accurate. It uses the child's age, gender, height, weight, parents' height along with some scaling factors and equations to predict the child's adult height.

• Bone-Age Method
The Bone-Age method is more accurate than the Kkamis-Roche method, but it requires that an X-ray of the hand. Obviously, Adult Height Calculator cannot take X-rays! Maybe a future version of our smart phones can :)"

"The secret to amazing abs?

We all want a toned, flat stomach. No surprise there. But since many women are still relying on crunches to get it, we want to make one thing clear: crunching is not the most effective abs workout. Crunches only work the muscles on the front and sides of your abdomen, but it's important to target all the muscles of the core to get more defined abs (including lower back, hips, and upper thighs).

To show off your abs, you have to burn fat. To burn fat, you have to stoke your metabolism by building muscle. Replacing just 1 pound of fat with muscle will force your body to fry up to an additional 50 calories a day. 

Are you finding it difficult to fit into your little black number? Is belly fat giving you sleepless nights? If your answer is yes, you need to make some lifestyle changes to get the figure of your dreams. No doubt, belly fat looks aesthetically displeasing. It can assume serious proportions and affect long term health, if not curbed at the right time.

Dieting and exercise go hand in hand. If you thought that only dieting will burn your belly fat, you are wrong. If you really want to lose weight, you need to include exercise in your daily routine for targeting and reducing belly fat. In this app we have compiled a list of 50 exercises that can help you reduce belly fat faster than you thought it would take.

"Exercise is one of the most effective and easily applicable methods for the treatment of sciatica pain. Sciatic nerve exercises will both reduce the pain in the waist and leg and help the healing of hernia. Sciatic nerve impingement is one of the major causes of low back pain. You can relieve the sciatic nerve and reduce your back pain by doing the exercises regularly.

Download our mobile app now and get rid of sciatica pain by doing sciatic exercises that we show for 10 minutes a day.

Sciatica exercises mainly include stretching and isometric exercises. Sciatica stretching provides rapid relief. With stretching, the muscles are lengthened and the pressure on the nerve decreases. In patients with lumbar hernia, pain is completely relieved with the removal of this nerve press. The next step is to strengthen the muscles to prevent recurrent disorders."

"👍 THE BEST APP FOR MUSLIMS 🧕👳‍♂‍
This  Halal Scan App will help you identify the preservatives, colorings or food chemical additives if they are Halal, Haram or Mushbooh  (that is doubtful). An important app for all Muslims concerned about what they eat.

Use the image scanner of the Halal Scan App in order to  quickly identify (in seconds) those products that you should avoid  (aim the camera well at the ingredients part of the product). 📷
 
In addition, you will be able to know if this preservatives, colorants or chemical additives is allowed by the most recognized authorities in the world of food such as the European Union 🇪🇺, American 🇺🇸 and Australia 🇦🇺. 📡

🏺 Our aim is to help Muslims not to worry about whether a product contains any Haram additives. Sometimes in supermarket products they contain preservatives, dyes or chemical food additives that can be marked by different names or E-codes (for example, E120 which is Haram since it comes from an insect). It is difficult for a Muslim to know all these names by heart. With  Halal Scan App  you will not have to worry as it identifies almost all the names of existing preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and shows them to you in a very simple way. 🏺


  MAIN FUNCTIONS:  
 
▶ ️  🔍 Flexible search engine: 
You can search by E-code or E-Number of preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and also by the name of the additive.

 



▶ ️  👁️‍🗨️Identify the additives in the product: 
Look for the ingredients part of the product and in a few seconds the E-code or E-number scanner will find what types of Halal or Haram additives.


▶ ️  🔥 Halal Image Scan: 
Use image scanning to identify if the product is Halal or Haram. The algorithm identifies the E-codes, E-numbers or names of additives.


▶ ️  🕹️ Assessment of each additive or scanned product: 
You can assess whether a preservative, color or chemical additive is considered Halal or Haram. This action helps not only us but also the Muslims of the world. And you can also rate the result of the scan and it will be analyzed by our team. Your opinion matters to us, because we are still meeting our goal of helping all Muslims in the world.


▶ ️  ☠️ Toxicity level 
Consult which additives are toxic or healthy for your health. In each additive you can know what level of toxicity it has.


▶ ️  🚫 Indication of authorizations by food associations: 
For each additive you will be able to know if an additive is allowed by the authorities of Europe, the United States or Australia.

▶ ️  📋 Save your history: 
All the product that you are going to scan will be saved in order to be able to refer to it again or share it with your loved ones. Then in one click you will be able to communicate said information that the products are Halal, Haram or Mushbooh and to be avoided if they are not halal.


 What is Zabihah or Dhabīḥah?  🐏
Animals such as cows, sheep, goats, deer, elk, chickens, ducks, game birds, etc., are also Halal, but must be Zabihah (slaughtered according to Islamic Rites) in order to be fit for consumption.
 

Some preservatives, colorants or chemical additives are not halal, since they come from animals that are not Zabihah or Dhabīḥah, for this reason they are haram for the Muslim who consumes it. 🐓
To ensure that a product containing animal remains is Zabihah or Dhabīḥah, you must ensure that it is sealed by a reliable Muslim organization.

This app will not tell you whether a product is Zabihah or not, but what it will tell you is whether the additive contains animal remains and you based on whether you are in a Muslim country or not will know if it is halal or mushbooh.

Halalcheck always tells you if a preservative, color or chemical additive is Halal or Haram. 🐄"

"CHAKRAS:
This app activates, harmonises and stabilises the 7 energy points in the  subtle body. These 7 “energy wheels” are connected to each other by a cogwheel system. Chakras can change direction due to shock or can even be completely stopped by unresolved issues. This results in the physical organs located in this region being supplied with less or no energy, making disease inevitable.
The spiral vibrations generated on the screen stimulate the chakras and free blockages. The resulting misinformation can then be consciously perceived by your mind and unblocked. If all the energy centres are free of blockages, the energy field can expand to its optimum size and supply the entire body with the necessary energy.
Users of this app are asked to enter their gender, as men and women’s chakras rotate in different directions. The mind or body may become temporarily impaired as a result of activating the energy centres or resolving issues.  
We wish you much success with the daily use of the app. The 5d-Flash Team

CELL CLUSTERS:
This app optimises cell clusters in the subtle body. Only repaired and stabilised cluster information in a human’s energy field allows the cell clusters to align themselves in the physical body and thus free them of their deformation. A stable and solid cell cluster is the key to optimal energy storage, whereby the energy level of the physical body can be steadily maintained and permanently accessed. 
This app greatly raises energy levels in the body and should therefore not be used immediately before going to bed, as it may lead to sleep disturbances.

BODY WATER
The human body is made up of over 70% water, so it is essential to form these water molecules into an optimal, balanced and stable cluster. Unfortunately, external influences constantly cause these molecular building blocks to become deformed, which means that energy cannot be stored.
The body water app can boost the primary power and stability in this molecular bond by means of the water’s information and eliminate any harmful obstructions by correctly tensioning this structure. Your body water will thank you for this information forever."
"Want to tone legs and butt? These exercises will get you there in no time at all. Pick a workout, or try them all to sculpt your glutes, hamstrings, quads, thighs, and calves.

These workouts will give you a well rounded butt and toned thighs and you need no equipment so you can exercise anywhere. The lower body exercises in this app are excellent for toning thighs, helping the heavy butt muscles fight back against gravity, and overall giving you a strong, capable, good looking pair of legs! 

This is a fun lower body workout that you can do anywhere. With the lengthy intervals, it ends up being a thighs and glutes workout that challenges both cardio and muscle endurance. 

You don't need any equipment at all for this legs and butt routine, however, if you want to step up the challenge and the benefits, you can always hold onto weights while doing these workouts. Even if you're doing this without any extra resistance, you're still going to feel it in your glutes and thighs. 

Give it a try!!!"

"Brain Waver allows full control over a Binaural Beats Generator with 18 high-definition relaxing background audio tracks also included for free! Binaural Beats use a theory called Brainwave Entrainment. Your brainwaves will naturally match the generated beats per second over approximately 15 minutes when using headphones at low to medium volume. This technique allows you to enter many different states of consciousness for Meditation, Sleep, and Concentration. Close your eyes and focus only on your breathing for best results!

The second Advanced Binaural Generator, found in the left slide out drawer, can fade between initial and ending Beats Per Second values to gently guide users towards their desired brainwave state. This second Generator can be played on top of the first for interesting multi-Binaural effects. Using the same Center Tone for both Generators (or slightly offset, I.E. 198 Hz for Basic and 200 Hz for Advanced) can also create mind bending Binaural interference patterns.

This app can also be used as a White Noise Generator for sleeping by setting the Binaural Beats volume to low or zero and choosing a background audio.

"PLEASE NOTE: It is NOT POSSIBLE to measure your blood pressure from this application.
You must use a suitable blood pressure monitor for this.
This application is intended to keep your statements for medical follow-up.

Hypertension must be taken very seriously. Beyond a simple risk factor, it is a real chronic disease.
Its constant progression is the consequence of the evolution of our lifestyles, in particular a diet too rich in fats and salt, as well as a decrease in physical activity.

If it cannot be cured, hypertension can be treated very well. Effective treatments now allow you to live longer and without disabling complications. As long as you know you are hypertensive!
To avoid being one of them, consider measuring your blood pressure regularly, at home or at your doctor's.
If you are already taking a treatment, try to follow it carefully: compliance is essential in controlling your hypertension!
You should also know that a treatment can only be effective if you also observe simple rules of healthy living.
Your involvement in your care and monitoring by your doctor will allow you to minimize the risks associated with hypertension.

A single dose with your doctor does not always re ﬂ ect reality, because the blood pressure varies according to the state of fatigue, emotivity, stress… To reduce the risk of error, you can take your blood pressure yourself even, with a suitable blood pressure measuring device that you can buy commercially or at any pharmacy. (note: this application is not a device for measuring your blood pressure; you need a suitable blood pressure monitor).

The ""My blood pressure"" application allows better monitoring of your hypertension. In this case, the measurement history allows you to see at a glance the evolution over time of your hypertension.
In addition, many tips - with automatic reminders - will help you on a daily basis; it is never superfluous to be regularly reminded of some judicious advice!

The application offers life hygiene advice, compliance rules, regularly updated information sheets, etc.
Finally, a very useful option allows you to send your doctor a personalized statement of your self-measurements.

Some features:
- Lifestyle advice sheets
- Compliance advice
- Hypertension information sheets
- International standards: manages the WHO and Joint Committee North American classification
- Generation of a pdf of your measurement reports for direct transmission to your doctor
- Reminder to take medication by receiving a notification

"This app provides different plank variations to help you lose weight, gain strength and get a stronger core. The mixing of static and dynamic planks really helps you burn fat fast. Take only 7 minutes a day to burn calories and get in better shape!

With 3 difficulty levels, the 30-day weight loss plan perfectly fits all fitness levels, and it suits both men and women. You can customize your training plan according to your own preferences. There's no equipment or gym needed; you can do plank workouts anywhere at anytime.

Why plank workout?
Planks are the most popular and effective fat burning exercise. They can be easily performed and activate all your muscles, including your core, shoulders, glutes, etc. Planks are the best choice for people with weak knees because they put no pressure on knees.

Maximize the belly fat burning: Planks are more effective than crunches at burning belly fat. Planks activate 100% of your abs, while crunches only involve 64% of them.

Strengthen your core: Plank workout fires up all your core muscle groups, enhances your core strength, and helps you get a strong core.

Reduce back pain: Plank workout can strengthen your back muscles, reduce back pain and lower the risk of back and spinal column injuries.

Improve your posture & balance: Plank workout requires your head, back and feet to be in a straight line. Regularly doing this will improve your balance and posture when sitting and standing.

Accelerate your metabolism: Doing planks keeps your metabolism high for the whole day; this dramatically boosts the fat burning process.

Improve your flexibility: Plank workout stretches all your posterior muscle groups, such as your shoulder blades, glutes and hamstrings, thus improving your flexibility and lowering the risk of injury.

"Use your Apple Watch to AUTOMATICALLY track your sleep!

Sleep++ takes advantage of the motion and health monitoring capabilities of your Apple Watch to measure both the duration and quality of your sleep.  The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  

My goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.  

AUTOMATIC MODE:
 
Simply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  

MANUAL MODE:

If you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. 

1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.
2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.
3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.

NOTES:

Sleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

"If you have migraine or get frequent headaches, you may benefit from keeping a headache diary.
Keeping detailed records of headache episodes can help provide additional insight about triggers and how to avoid them.

This app is designed to help you understand and manage your headachesby recording information about them and any treatments used (medicine and non-medicine options).
Your doctor will want to know the overall pattern of your headaches, how they affect you, the treatments used and what the triggers may be. Doctors and people who experience frequent and persistent headaches have found that keeping a diary for one month can help you and your doctor get more from your consultation. 

Use our headache diary to:
- Track the frequency of your headaches, the treatments used and how effective they were for you
- Understand your headache experience / patterns including symptoms and triggers
- Be better prepared to discuss your headache with your health professional.

It is important to write down information about your headaches. Every time you have a headache, make notes in your diary. This information will help you and your healthcare provider learn about your headaches. This will also help you and your health provider make a plan for treating your headache. 

It is also important to make an appointment with your doctor for the specific purpose of addressing your headache history rather than discussing headaches as part of a physician visit for other reasons. We also recommend keeping a headache diary to track the characteristics of your headaches. Patterns identified from your diary may help your doctor determine which type of headache you have and the most beneficial treatments."

"Struggle to do even one pull-up? Don’t worry – this app is guaranteed to teach even total beginners to do their first pull up and a handful more in just a month.

Master the pull-ups and get awesome back, lats and arms with guidance and tips from our own fitness and bodybuilding trainer. All exercises have on-point descriptions with photos showing correct exercise techniques.

If you dream to make your back stand out, strengthen and shape-up your arms, or just aim at improving your posture – pull-ups are what you need. A pull-up is one of the best upper-body exercises for building muscle and increasing strength of the back and biceps. It also shows your level of strength and physical condition. However, it’s a difficult exercise so first you will have to build up to a pull up.

With our 30-day pull-up program you will go through three stages of load:

The first stage – learning the correct basic technique. A resistance band will aid in the process, or if it is not available, a low pull-up bar. With a counterweight at your disposal, you can do pull-ups while strengthening the very muscle groups bearing the most load during this exercise.

The second stage – negative pull-ups. You will jump onto the pull-up bar and lower yourself slowly.

Finally, the third stage – body weight pull-ups, first with a jump and later without it.

You will need to do all the exercises during one and the same workout. We recommend exercising every other day."

"Running app with pace calculator, accurate race predictor and running splits

Pace Calculator
The running pace calculator is the main function of the application. Its a multi purpose tool for runners that instantly updates distance, speed or time as needed. Enter a race distance and target time to check the pace needed. Convert between pace per mile, pace per kilometre or pace per 400m. Standard race distances are available for selection or alternatively enter your own distance. Speed conversions can be useful for runners who run on a treadmill. Instead of minutes per mile or minutes per kilometre you can enter your running speed in kph, mph or m/s.

Cadence calculator shows you your stride length at a given cadence. You can update either stride length or cadence to see how the other is affected. For example, if I run a 5k in 20 minutes at 180 steps per minute how many meters am I covering with each stride. It's generally advised that 180 steps per minute is a good aim for the average runner. Elite 5k runners can cover over 2 meters per stride!

Age Grading is available in the pace calculator for 5k, 10k, half marathon and marathon. This compares your time over the distance to the world record time based on age and gender. It's a nice way to compare your result to a runner of another gender, different age category, or just running a different race distance. 

Elevation Calculator let's you calculate the gradient of a hill or the amount of elevation that you will gain running at a particular gradient. For example if I run for 6 miles on a treadmill at 4% how many meters have I gained?

Body Mass Index – (BMI) is a guide to the healthy weight range for your height used by the government and health professionals. It might not be applicable to every body type but its a good starting point! Enter your height and weight in lbs or kilograms to get your BMI score and a useful BMI reference guide. You can set a preference to show or hide the BMI section from the pace calculator if you wish.

Race Predictor
If you have a race time and you would like to get an estimate of what you might be running in another race you can use the race time predictor. Here you enter a time for any of the provided race distances and all other distances instantly update with your predicted finish time at that distance. Example usage as a marathon time predictor: I run my local 5k parkrun in 25 minutes. How long do you think it will take me to run a marathon? Race predictions are available for 400m, 800m, 1k, 1500m, 1 mile, 3k, 5k, 5 miles, 10k, 10 miles, half marathon and marathon.

Running Splits
Finally you can use Running Calculator to plan your race strategy using the running splits screen. Pick a distance from 800m, 1500m, 5k, 10k, half marathon, marathon or a custom distance in miles or kilometres, enter your finish time and we'll display the splits that you will need to run for that time. You can configure whether you would like the splits listed per kilometre, per mile, per 400m, per 5 kilometres or per 5 miles. Why not try it out at your next parkrun or race and see how you get on?

These functions should prove useful for 5k training, half marathon training and marathon training. If there are other functions that Running Calculator should handle then please get in touch.

"☆ Don't be robbed of a good night's sleep!
bluelight from your smartphone or tablet causes strain on your eyes and prevents you from falling asleep easily at night.
This app adjusts your screen color to reduce the blue light and helps your eyes to relax, making it easier for you to fall asleep.
☆ Features
▽ Free Screen filter App to Protect Your Eyes
You can reduce the strain on your eyes easily.
It is simple but effective!
All you have to do is launch this app.
▽ Screen filter with Natural Color
This app's filter has a natural color so you can read news, emails and websites clearly.
This app doesn't dim the screen but adjusts the screen color to reduce blue light which causes strain on your eyes.
This natural color filter makes your smartphone screen shift to the screen for night.
▽ Easy Operation
It is easy to turn on or off with just one tap. 
You can adjust the opacity of the filter.

▽ Startup Automatically

Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? twilight may be a solution for you!
Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.

The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.

In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.

The twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.

Get more from twilight
1) Bed reading: twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen
Do you feel the light of your mobile screen is too strong?
Do you feel your eyes fatigued after watching the phone screen for a long time?
Does the glare of the screen make your eyes uncomfortable when you play phone in the bed at night?
Do you feel your vision is blurry after long-use phone?
All of these problems are caused by the blue light that emitted from the phone screen. Which will bring you eye strain and vision loss if you looked at the screen for a long time without rest.

Now, with this application, you can easily get rid of the blue light.
We have these advantages:
- Heavily reduce the blue light to relieve eye fatigue and protect your eyes;

"A low-carb diet means that you eat fewer carbohydrates and a higher proportion of fat. This can also be called a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF) or a keto diet.

For decades we’ve been told that fat is detrimental to our health. Meanwhile low-fat “diet” products, often full of sugar, have flooded supermarket shelves. This has been a major mistake, that coincided with the start of the obesity epidemic.

Studies now show that there’s no reason to fear natural fats. Fat is your friend (here’s why). On a low-carb diet, you instead minimize your intake of sugar and starches. You can eat other delicious foods until you are satisfied and still lose weight.

How does it work? When you avoid sugar and starches, your blood sugar stabilizes and the levels of the fat-storing hormone insulin drop. This increases fat burning and makes you feel more satiated, reducing food intake and causing weight loss.

The first module we are releasing is for weight loss. Set up a group, invite your friends, weigh in, see your progress, and talk amongst yourselves all within the app!

Getting started is easy. First, create a group by setting the start date, duration, and the buy-in amount. Invite friends to join and once you reach the start date, start weighing in.

1) Weekly match-up: each week we'll pair you with someone new. If you lose more percentage weight than your match-up, you win this prize.
2) Weekly biggest loser: lose the highest percentage weight in your group and you win the weekly biggest loser prize
3) Competish first place: if you lose the most percentage weight in your group by the end of the Competish, you take home the big draw
4) Competish second place: if you lose the second highest percentage weight, you get the runner-up prize.

Key features:
* Easily create a group and invite friends to get started
* Submit weigh-ins by taking a picture of your feet on the scale
* Review other players weigh-ins
* Track progress and see who is in the lead every week, as well as your current winnings

"As we all know, drinking clean water is the fundamental thing that we need in our daily life. Water lubricates your joints, protects your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues, and helps to regulate your body temperature. This would make sense since 60 per cent of the human adult body is made up of water.
 
Our Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss is created as guidelines and references to drink water in the right way at the right time to lose weight. With the right knowledge and safety guidelines, you can lose weight with a water diet, shed those pounds and have a healthier lifestyle.

Benefits of a Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss:
+  Flushes out toxins and excess sodium in the body
+  A healthy and natural way to lose weight and belly fat
+  Aims to cleanse and detoxify your body naturally
+  Debloats the body (belly fat and waist fat)
+  Sheds away excess fat and helps lose weight

What is the smart and best water diet plan?
A water diet is when a person does not eat and drinks nothing other than water for a short period of time, anywhere from 24 hours to 3 days as the maximum time to go without food. Water fasting may be undertaken for a number for different reasons, including spiritual, diet, or medical reasons.

In a nutshell, a pure water fast is among the most trying type of fast or cleansing diet. A water fast costs nothing to do, and may be used to lose some weight, and possibly help your body flush out toxins for a healthier system.

Just like many other diet apps for women and men like the Super Military Diet and Keto Diet Plan, water fast diet plan is a simple weight loss plan set in a way that helps users shed those pounds by making changes to their daily diet that in time flushes out toxins, slowly allowing the body to get the best of the nutrients afterwards.

The Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss is sometimes known as the cold water diet and is among one of the latest fads that appeal to dieters who want to melt away their fat. Compared to fasting ""cleanse"" diets and those that restrict caloric intake, such as the Rice Diet, the Water Diet doesn't limit food consumption, nor does it require exercise. The appeal of the Water Diet is that dieters can purportedly eat what they want--and still lose weight.

As a water diet plan that aims to lose weight and for weight loss, it is strongly recommends us to drink plenty of water. So, one can reduce the consumption of foods that contain lots of sugar. With this new habit you will reduce the calories in your body. In addition, by consuming fruit and green vegetables on your daily meals with drinking plenty of water helps to balance out your body metabolism and cleanse your body from toxins. 

We hope our best Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss has helped you lose weight with water and made you feel better about yourself, mentally and physically. Feel free to leave some feedback if it helped.

"Dumbbell workout inspired by Bruce Lee's circuit training routine to get ripped. It can be done in as little as 7 minutes as a home workout.

All you need is a pair of dumbbells. I'd recommend picking a challenging enough weight that you can do between 8-12 reps of dumbbell curls with. So if that's 25lbs, then start with a pair of 25lb dumbbells. 

In order to progress, you can increase the time and reps or increase the weight.

A relaxation technique (relaxation training) is any method (include audio therapy, sleep sounds and nature sounds), process, procedure, or activity that helps a person to relax; to attain a state of increased calmness; or otherwise reduce levels of anxiety, stress or anger.Yoga music, massage, audio therapy, nature sounds, relax melodies, bird songs and other techniques that include deep breathing tend to calm people who are overwhelmed by stress, while rhythmic exercise improves the mental and physical health of those who are depressed. People who encounter both symptoms, feeling depressed in some ways and overexcited in others, may do best by walking, listening natural sounds of rain, thunderstorms, birds or performing yoga techniques that are focused on strength.

"Talking Stopwatch is a feature rich precision talking audio timer app. This digital speaking stopwatch and lap timer is clear, simple to use, yet highly configurable for advanced sports users. 

This free speech stopwatch app is simple to operate, yet packed with features & speech options not found on other stopwatches and lap timers such as speed/pace calculations and countdown to start & target time.

Follow us on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/talking.stopwatch/ where we post periodically free upgrade codes.

Current lap time, split times, target lap time, speed, countdown timers, screen lock, stats, speech, side button operation and touch screen locking make Talking Stopwatch the ideal sports talk timer for runners and athletes.

Clarity
The audio timer display is large and clear even in bright sunlight, a very important consideration for running, jogging, sailing or cycling. The audio timer has multiple screens views accessed via a horizontal swipe. 

Accuracy
Lap timer operates precisely to 1/1000 second via on-touch actions (not on-press). Nearly all other stopwatches and lap timers operate on press... these timers are not as accurate as this app since a press can take up to 1/3 second and yet a touch is instantaneous.

Easy operation on the move
For a speaking stopwatch to be used when actually performing an exercise or activity such as running, there are considerations that most stop watches and split timers do not address. Ideally a user should be able to operate the timer when in a pocket or other location from which the screen may not be visible. Side button operation, speech and touch screen locking combine to allow Talking Stop watch to be used easily in this way.

Adaptability as a multi-use timer
Talking Stopwatch was designed as a track timer for runners and athletes but can be used for all tasks such as audio timing an egg."

"Stretching training gives the body flexibility and significantly reduces the risk of injury.

Tendons, ligaments and joints are involved in muscle interaction and the skeletal system during exercise. Stretching gives flexibility to the whole body. Enhanced and flexible ligaments, tendons and muscles increase the power – it is possible to perform more dynamic, powerful moves with greater load without risk of injury.

After an intense workout, working muscles tense and contract. Regular, heavy exercises cause that the muscles stiffen and shorten, resulting in a limitation of the entire body’s locomotive scope. Growth of the muscles without stretching can cause pressure on the nerves and slow the flow of nerve impulses, and sometimes even their blockade.

Regular trainings without stretching can lead to a permanent feeling of tension in your body, loss of energy, feeling of fatigue as well as muscle and joint pains."

"Anesoft 'ACLS Rhythm Tutor' is one of the series of apps from Anesoft Corporation to improve your ACLS resuscitation skills. This app will teach and reinforce an organized approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. 

Recognition of ECG rhythms as the waveforms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.

The app utilizes an organized four criteria approach to identify the rhythms. Then study the description of the rhythm to understand the electrophysiology. Use the same process to review all the ECG rhythms.

There are 80 ECG rhythms included in this app.

When you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should test yourself using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Rhythm Quiz'."

The cellular component consists of three major cell types, all of which arise from hematopoietic stem cells located primarily in the bone marrow: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC, erythrocytes) are hemoglobin-carrying cells that primarily transport oxygen. White blood cells (WBC, leukocytes) take the form of either granulocytes or lymphocytes. Granulocytes are part of the innate immune system and play a key role in the immune response to bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Lymphocytes are highly antigen-specific, meaning they are able to target specific infectious agents, atlas of hematology primarily viruses. Platelets are the other major cellular component of blood and are small anucleate cells produced from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. This learning card provides an overview of the production, morphology, and most important functions of blood cells.

Introduction
Function of blood
Transports oxygen, nutrients, metabolic waste products
Regulation of body temperature, signal transmission, acid-base homeostasis, and immune response
Composition of blood
60–80 mL blood/kg body weight ≅ 5 L blood for an adult weighing 70 kg/154 lbs
45% cellular components (→ hematocrit), 55% plasma

Production of blood
Location: bone marrow; the spleen and liver are the primary sites before birth
Hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into any type of blood cell and give rise to all blood cells through the following two precursor cells:
Lymphoid precursor cells: origin of lymphocytes and natural killer cells
Myeloid precursor cells: origin of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and megakaryocytes
Left shift (or blood shift): an increase in immature precursor cells (e.g., increase in band neutrophils with rod-shaped nuclei in response to acute inflammation) in the blood. In most cases, infection is the cause of a left shift.
A reactive increase of a cell line ends in ""-cytosis"" (e.g., leukocytosis); neoplastic increase is referred to as ""-emia"" (e.g., leukemia).

Overview
Bone marrow is the spongy, soft tissue that fills the hollow spaces within cancellous (spongy) bone. It is composed of stromal cells and stem cells, which are the progenitors of all five blood cell lineages. Hematopoiesis is the main function of the bone marrow. It also filters aging RBCs and houses immune cells (e.g., plasma cells)."

"EasyRoute is a route planner for outdoor activities like running, biking and walking.

Simply tap the places you want to go along the way. It will follow roads and paths while also providing the freedom to route directly where you touch.

You can use EasyRoute for all of the following:

• Plan biking, running or walking routes while customizing them to be both enjoyable and safe. You can simply tap your start and destination points, or tap roads or paths you’d prefer to use along the way. You can drag the route to customize it as well.

• Let it guide you through the route on either iPhone or Apple Watch. It works equally well in the background so you can use it alongside any of the great workout tracking and analysis apps in the App Store, including the built-in workout app. (With an Apple Watch, you can also optionally record a workout to Health while following a route)

• Customize the directions by adding, editing or removing instructions.

• Download data for offline use, so you can route in areas with no network connection.

• Share routes with others or export them to your devices -- works great with Wahoo ELEMNT bike computers! ;)

• Schedule a route and have a shown as a watch complication.

• Enable iCloud to make routes on your iPad and sync them to your iPhone

There are still many more tweaks, improvements, features and enhancements planned.

Note if you go off the route while following it, EasyRoute will issue some simple guidance and provide the right instruction when you come back on, but it does not (yet) do full re-routing.

"Meat Recipes app offers you a wide and curated collection of meat dishes from all around the world. It is an animal flesh that can be eaten as food. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. It is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Chicken on the grill will seduce your taste buds and also ensure you a healthy diet. Different categories of healthy meat recipes are there.

Meat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or ethical preferences, as well as economic conditions. It can be broadly classified as ""red"" or ""white"" depending on the concentration of myoglobin in muscle fiber. Meat is valued as a complete protein food containing all the amino acids necessary for the human body. The fat of meat varies widely with the species, quality, and cut. It is a valuable source of energy and also influences the flavor, juiciness, and tenderness of the lean.

Fresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed. It can be treated for longer-term preservation and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. It is prepared in many ways as steaks, in stews, fondue, or as dried meat like beef. It may be ground then formed into patties as hamburgers or croquettes, loaves. Meat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish. Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef or horse meat.

Meat is a typical base for making sandwiches. Popular varieties of sandwich meat include ham, pork, salami, and beef, such as steak, roast beef, corned beef, pepperoni, and pastrami. It can also be molded or pressed and canned.

"Learning the art of ECG interpretation requires intellect, commitment, effort and — perhaps most importantly — an organized approach. ECG Interpretation A - Z Approach

ECGs Made Easy?

I imagine it is understood that learning all of ECG interpretation is going to take more than 10 minutes of your time and that it is not quite so easy. To be proficient, it will take a bit of effort. Some memorization and pattern recognition will be required. The more you see, the more you will remember. Having a pair of calipers is helpful.

Step 1. Learn the Basics of a 12-lead ECG Tracing

First things first. Knowing the basic parts of an ECG tracing will lay a good foundation for everything else that is to come. The different waves, complexes and intervals need to be ingrained in your brain. How many seconds is a full ECG tracing? How much time does each big box and each little box represent?

This is not the time to learn the crazy things such as the different P-wave morphologies that occur with atrial enlargements and ectopic atrial rhythms — but rather, just to know what the normal P wave looks like and what it represents. It’s a similar concept for the other parts of the ECG.

Read ECG Basics.

Step 2. Determine Heart Rate on the ECG

To determine whether bradycardia, a normal heart rate or tachycardia is present requires the knowledge to calculate the heart rate on the ECG. Remember to apply these techniques to both the atrial rate, measured by the rate of the P wave, and the ventricular rate, measured by the rate of the QRS complex.

Read Determining Rate.

Step 3. Determine Axis on the ECG

The axis on the ECG can give a clue to many different pathologic states. Unless you are going into electrophysiology as a career, the only axis that you need to measure is that of the QRS complex.

Be sure to know the causes of left axis deviation, right axis deviation and when the axis is indeterminate (northwestern). Also, know the quick shortcuts to determine the axis.

Read Determining Axis.

Step 4. Learn Abnormal Heart Rhythms

Learning a normal sinus rhythm was taken care of in Step 1. Now, learn the below rhythms like the back of your hand. Be sure to review multiple examples of each in the individual ECG Reviews and Criteria sections below.

Atrial Fibrillation ECG
Atrial Flutter ECG
Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG
Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT) ECG
Ectopic Atrial Rhythms ECG
First-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block ECG
Idioventricular Rhythms ECG
Junctional Rhythms ECG
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) ECG
Second-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block Type I (Wenkebach) ECG
Second-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block Type II ECG
Sinus Arrhythmia ECG
Sinus Bradycardia ECG
Sinus Tachycardia ECG
Third-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block ECG
Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) ECG
Wandering Atrial Pacemaker (WAP) ECG

Step 5. Learn Chamber Hypertrophies and Bundle Blocks

Sometimes this can be the most difficult part. Atrial enlargements are not too bad, but the criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy can drive you crazy. No need to memorize then all, just the main two or three.

Left and right bundle branch are not too bad, either. The “bunny ears” are easy to spot in right bundle branch blocks — though not always present. Don’t forget to learn what a non-specific interventricular conduction delay looks like, as well.

Step 6. Learn Acute MI and Ischemic ECG Findings

Step 7. Learn the Everything Else Including Atypical ECG Findings

Step 8. Review ECGs in Real Patient Case Scenarios

Step 9. Teach Others How to Read an ECG

"People who monitor health know that maintaining the body's water balance, you need to drink water daily. Maintaining water balance is also the basis of healthy lifestyle for women, as it helps to maintain skin tone. The norm of water per day is individual for each person and depends on age, body weight, loads and environmental conditions. The drinking regimen for weight loss is affected by age, state of health and a specific diet.
A healthy body is a consequence of many factors, including the correct hydrobalance. It is inconvenient to memorize and record how much fluid was drunk and how much more was left to be consumed per day. For statistics on the use of pure H2O, use the application “Water Tracker”.
“Water Tracker” is an easy and functional reminder to drink water throughout the day, which helps you drink water on time, restore water balance, lose weight, maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve your health.

Use our app to record drinking water if you want:
● Drink water for weight loss at the right time
● Get rid of toxins
● Cleanse the skin
● Replenish the supply of minerals and trace elements in the body
● Maintain fluid balance

Build Your Water Purpose
Depending on the gender and weight settings, a water control with a reminder will automatically calculate the right amount per day based on your indicators. Therefore, in order to know how much water to drink per day, you only need to enter your parameters.

Individual adjustment of fluid intake
The ability to quickly add any drink makes the accounting of drinking water more accurate. Water consumption will depend on the type of drinks you drink, because the percentage of pure H2O varies depending on the liquid. The drink tracker provides information on the level of hydration for different drinks. Choose the individual amount of liquid you drink, whether it is black or green tea, slimming tea, coffee, juice, milk, cola, soda.

Smart reminders
Reminders will not distract you from rest - choose the time of your rest and notifications will not interrupt sleep.
 To remember to drink water, adjust the interval between reminders. Also, you can manually set the date and time when the application sends a notification.
In a few taps, you can select a mode for notifications: sound, vibration or silent mode. If necessary, a reminder can be delayed.

Statistics for motivation
The water meter has a convenient drinking diary that stores information for the day, week, month and year. Statistics are presented in the form of a graph with information for the month and year. In addition, there is a report on the average water consumption for a week and a month. And the parameter “Frequency of drinking” will tell you how many times a day, on average, you drink liquid.
The schedule for drinking water will indicate how many days the body has maintained sufficient hydro-balance, this will motivate you to drink water and be healthy.

Start leading a healthy lifestyle by regulating the body’s water-salt balance. Using our application, water control with a reminder will help you keep statistics, maintain water balance and not skip water intake.
Use the program as a water tracker for weight loss, then the correct water balance and weight control will soon yield results.


Drink water, go to fitness and health will not let you down!"

"Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.

We created multiple workout routine with stretches for:
- Full Body
- Lower Body: leg, hip, glute and lower back stretches
- Upper Body: upper back, chest, shoulder and neck stretches
- Yoga for better flexibility

Beginners can do all the stretching exercises we provide.

It's true that stretching is neither glamorous nor hardcore, and it probably won't give you the same rush that a run or HIIT class will.
Luckily, improving your flexibility and mobility isn't hard. It just takes a little time. Try adding the stretches for flexibility your workout routine to help relieve muscle tension and increase mobility—so that you can move through both the gym and life more freely.

Stretching is essential for improving flexibility, which is an important component of overall fitness, along with mobility, strength, power, and endurance.

If they’re not already a part of your workout regimen, read on to learn which stretching exercises are best for warming up, cooling down, and improving overall fitness. Stretching is an important part of fitness: It can improve your range of motion, increase circulation, and calm your mind—which may help fend off injuries and illness, as well as bring on a better night’s sleep.

Stretches for back pain relief:
When you're dealing with the aches and oftentimes debilitating soreness of lower-back pain, there's a good chance all you want to do is stay in bed. Yet research found that any kind of exercise—whether it's core strengthening, aerobic exercise, or stretching—is the best way to ease pain and reduce the risk of another back pain attack.

The nice thing about gentle stretching is that it's feasible to do when you're in pain—and often provides the fastest relief."

A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation. Application of the term has varied greatly during the last several centuries, both because of this ambiguity in the application of the term and its use it popular culture. Jungles in European and Western literature, often represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation because of its association in colonial discourse with places that were colonised by Europeans.

Rainforests are forests characterized by high rainfall, with definitions based on a minimum normal annual rainfall of 1750–2000 mm.

Why fast anyway? 

Fasting is a terrific way to retrain your mind and body to eat only when you are truly hungry. From a scientific standpoint, fasting is the metabolic state where you have completed the digestion and absorption of a meal (around 3 to 5 hours after eating). While you fast, your body continues to burn excess fat. You might start out fasting from dinner to breakfast, and then work towards fasting from dinner to lunch. With practice, you can fast for longer periods of time. It’s important to only use fasting for healthy weight loss. Fasting can be deadly for people under the normal recommended weight for their age and gender. 

You can use fasting with most diets. A popular combination is using fasting with the Ketogenic diet since the Ketogenic diet is already burning fat for fuel. There are also different durations for how long to fast. A popular choice to start out with is the 16 hours fasting/8 hours to eat window that lasts each 24 hour cycle. Once you conquer this you can consider trying out intermittent fasting where you’ll fast for 18 hours in between each meal. If you eat dinner the night before then you can start your next meal as a late lunch lunch, and so on. There are several other extended durations for fasting. We recommend starting out slowly, feeling confident with the duration and then making adjustments to fast for a longer time. 

Fasting isn’t appropriate for everyone. Please consult your doctor before starting a fast. This is especially important if you are diabetic. We are only here to help you track, your doctor is there to help you do it safely."

- Section diet for weight loss:

Probably any woman, at all times, sooner or later wondered - how to lose weight quickly and effectively? Are there really effective diets for quick weight loss, or is it all the marketing move of sellers of all possible dietary supplements. Is it possible to use fasting for weight loss of 10 kg per week. Our application will tell you all about diets, what diets are, how to lose weight, how to lose weight quickly, diet menu, how to choose a diet for yourself, diet food, diets for a week, diet for weight loss 10 kg per week or buckwheat diet.

Do you know who Manuel Isaakovich Pevzner is? This is a well-known nutritionist. Pevzner diets are known to many.

- Weight Loss Section:

Probably the main step on the road to getting rid of excess weight is to remember the main principle of losing weight for yourself. You lose weight when you consume less food than your body can spend during the day. In this case, energy begins to be drawn from the reserve reserves on the body - fat deposits. Therefore, in fact, the process of losing weight is reduced to restrictions on food and creating a calorie deficit. How to lose weight in a month: tips and tricks that really work. We will also analyze how many kilograms you can lose weight in a month without harming your health. The results of losing weight for each will be individual, since they depend on the lifestyle that a person leads, on how much time he “ate” extra pounds, what kind of food he adheres to, and so on. Perhaps you often wonder if it is worth arranging fasting days? What diet for weight loss 10 kg per week is the most effective and make the right nutrition menu for every day. Our application will help you with this.

- Section Proper nutrition:

Any diets and nutritional systems essentially create the same calorie deficit in which your body begins to expend fat from its reserves.
Therefore, from a practical point of view, it does not matter how you create this “deficit”. You can count calories, you can choose a popular diet
for weight loss 10 kg per week, you can switch to proper nutrition, you can simply reduce the consumption of high-calorie foods.
No matter which diet or nutrition system you choose, with a calorie deficit, you will lose weight. Needless to say, without proper balanced nutrition it is impossible to achieve any results in losing weight? Even if you go to the gym ... 70% of success depends on the diet and the right choice of diet.
How to make the right diet for weight loss menus or diet menus for a more effective result? This section will give an answer.

In our application, there are also such topics as:

how to lose weight
for quick weight loss
diet food
what are the diets

I created this app during an ankle injury recovery. It's hard to keep training when you're hurt, but it's really important not to stop to recover faster.
If for any reason you cannot stand, it does not mean you have to give up your healthy amount of daily physical activity.

Sitting Cardio features exercises for the upper body that will tone your arms, shoulders, pectorals and back, but at the same time will make you sweat and burn calories.

Exercising the upper body is also known to help eliminating excess liquids from the lower body, so don’t worry if you can’t use your legs muscles for a while, these workouts will keep you fit until you can walk and exercise your full body again.

You can do these exercises while sitting on the bed or on a comfortable chair without armrests. 

You will burn calories, tone your arms and increase blood circulation, also improving drainage in the lower body.

These workouts can be handy even if you don’t have problems but you feel more tired than usual and prefer to train sitting down. 

I tried to make the exercises fun but effective. If at the beginning you find them too intense, do what you can and continue to move with the music until you are ready to start again.

The app features short or long workouts for different levels of fitness.

Before starting any physical activity consult your doctor. Show the type of training you are going to do and ask him if it is suitable for you and your state of health.

"Do you often work at night? Do you constantly deal with dry & itchy eyes? Do you also have trouble falling asleep?

Then the Blue Light Filter app might be a solution for you. 

Blue Light Filter is a free app that aims to revolutionise nighttime phone usage. This app is perfect for smartphone users who like to spend the last half hour of the day curled in bed while browsing social media on their phones. 

Prolonged phone usage at night could lead to dry eyes and eye strain. The Blue Light Filter app protects your eyes from harmful Blue Light and provides a soothing effect. This app adjusts your screen temperature to make your screen warmer(More Orange). Your eyes will thank you for it.

What else does Blue Light do to your body & mind?

This is no secret that looking at your devices at night in a dark room can make it harder to fall and stay asleep. Screens produce blue light so we can see them even on sunny days. But at night, this brightness mimics the sun - sending mixed signals to the brain about what time is bedtime. The brain stops producing melatonin, a hormone that gives your body the ""time to sleep"" cues and throws your circadian rhythm out of whack. Not only does sleep suffer, but your risk goes up for ailments ranging from depression to cancer. Over time, not getting enough sleep can lead to a buildup of neurotoxins that make it even more challenging to doze off.

Features

Shields you Eyes
This protects you eyes from damage & strain so that you can stay productive. Helps you sleep faster & deeper.

Blocks Blue Light
Eliminates Blue Light by reducing the color temperature of your display. This app also lets you adjust the display brightness.

Select Mode
This app lets you select the intensity of the filter by manually selecting your preferred color temperature. 

Intensity Modes
Daylight(6500k)
Sunlight(5500k)
Florescent(4200k)
Halogen(3400k)
Incandescent(2700k)
Dim-Incandescent(2300k)
Candle(1900k)

Schedule Filter
The blue light filter will automatically turn ON/OFF based on the custom schedule you have created.

Smart Notification
Switch the filter ON/OFF, turn on Candle Mode, and take screenshots directly from your status bar. You can find your screenshots inside the app.

IS IT EFFECTIVE?
It’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's ""fat-burning"" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.

IS IT SAFE?
Yes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.

With various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women. It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it.

"Do you want to have a perfect posture and healthy spine? You can get it with simple and fast exercises.
Perfect Posture app will help you to exercise at home without the need of any equipment.

Why is good posture important?
Good posture helps us stand, walk, sit, and lie in positions that place the least strain on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement and weight-bearing activities. 

Benefits of correct posture:
* Reduced low back pain
* Fewer headaches
* Increased energy levels
* Less tension in your shoulders and neck
* Decreased risk of abnormal wearing of the joint surfaces
* Increased lung capacity
* Improved circulation and digestion
* Easier and deeper breathing
* Healthy spine
* Decreased risk of scoliosis
* Decreased risk of osteoporosis
* Decreased risk of thoracic outlet syndrome
* Decreased risk of text neck
* Decreased risk of many posture related problems

Can I correct my posture?
In a word, yes. Remember, however, that long-standing postural problems will typically take longer to address than short-lived ones, as often the joints have adapted to your long-standing poor posture.

"Health is more valuable than gold.
W. Shakespeare

      It is imperative to keep your weight normal and under control. It is no secret that an excess of extra pounds leads to a risk of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, vascular atherosclerosis, arthritis and some cancers.
 
       With this application, you can find out not only your body mass index (BMI), calculate the percentage of body fat, but also determine the normal weight (according to the modern version of Brock's formula) for both women and men. Also, using a calorie calculator, calculate the daily requirement and, depending on your goal, set the daily rate. A nice addition would be the WHO recommendation for sugar intake."

What is guided meditation?

If we were to use a metaphor to describe it, we could say that guided meditation is like the two small wheels that are attached to the bicycle of children who learn to ride. They use it to make their first pedal strokes without falling, but the goal is, sooner or later, to get rid of it.
Indeed, guided mediation is mainly aimed at beginners. By offering step-by-step support in the first experiences of meditation, it serves to support those who do not know how to go about it or who are just afraid of doing wrong.
Here, instead of two small wheels, it is a voice that accompanies us in our first steps. And all we have to do is follow it.
Guided meditation sessions can take place both in groups, with a guide, and on their own, using an app or video. In all cases, a voice will guide you throughout the session. With an often calm and slow intonation that will call for relaxation, it will help you reach the right state of concentration and relaxation to let you go into meditation.
To explain it better, we can use a second metaphor: guided meditation works like a GPS. It shows you the path to follow to avoid that, at each intersection, you don't wonder where to go.
The voice will explain to you how to proceed at each step so that you always know what to do without having to think about it yourself. The goal is to help you go through an entire meditation session without giving your mind the opportunity to frolic all over the place and to ask yourself all the time whether you are doing things right or whether you should you do it differently.
Like the two small wheels and the GPS, guided meditation is especially useful during your first sessions. Indeed, after a number of them, not only will you know the path to take, but you will also need no help whatsoever to move forward. By that time, the guided meditation will have reached its goal and you will then be able to meditate alone ... unless you prefer to go a long way with it!

Why use guided meditation?

First, it makes meditation accessible to all. Firstly because no prior knowledge is required to start guided meditation, but also because, by taking us by the hand, it allows us to discover a world that may seem intimidating at first.
By accompanying us and showing us the path to follow from the start, guided meditation thus breaks down the many barriers that we can erect in front of us at the time of learning meditation, such as the fear of s '' put it alone and make mistakes, lack of motivation or not knowing where to start or having trouble learning on our own.
It thus helps us to take the first step towards meditation. But more importantly, it also helps us do it right. Step by step, it teaches us the main concepts of meditation so that we can make them ours. It helps us find the right posture, the right breath and the right approach, and teaches us what to focus on during a session. Nothing is left out, so you can be sure you are learning without making a mistake.
Finally, guided meditation is responsible for answering, implicitly or explicitly, all the questions that often mistreat our concentration during our first sessions, such as “am I doing well?”, “When will I finally get to make a vacuum? ”,“ why does this seem not to work for me? ”or“ should I think of something else? ”. As a result, you can focus on the essentials instead of letting your mind fill with many questions that, without guided meditation, could go unanswered."

Some users reported acupressure points were not displayed sometimes. This is due to insufficient memory caused by other applications running in background. The solution is terminating some background tasks or rebooting your iPhone/iPod Touch.

"Soundly Sleeping helps your sleep by reducing the amount of external noise you will be subject to.

It produces continuous, uninterrupted random noise that effectively cancels out other sounds. All you have to do is pick between the exact randomness that suits your audio source best: white, pink, or brown. Essentially the sound gets lower from first to last - simply try out what works best for you. Set your volume - not too loud, we don't want to hurt your ears - and have a good night's sleep!

You might also try the app in the following situations:

* On a plane and you want to relax or sleep undisturbed
* When repetitive sounds (like clock ticking or gentle snoring) keep you awake
* To mask out street noises if you live in a loud neighborhood

Give Soundly Sleeping a try if you have a headache, a migraine, tinnitus, insomnia, or you simply are looking for some privacy.

Try playing it for your kids if they won't fall asleep or your baby if it is crying."

"Do you wish something that would replace only the cigarette but keep the smoking habit?

This app wants to challenge the way of quitting smoking by replacing the real cigarette with a simulated one, which takes the same amount of time as a real one to ""smoke"". You can keep a track of how many real cigarettes you replaced with a simulated one, and won't have to give up those smoke breaks.
Want to quit smoking and you tried all the existing methods you have heard of? Quitting cold turkey didn't help me either, because after 2 or 3 days, I was back to buying a new pack of cigarettes and smoking half of it in one day, because I felt that I deserved to. 

 But with this app, you can trick your brain into thinking that you are smoking, because:
- App will tell you to synchronize your breathing with the virtual cigarette, so you get the feeling that you're still inhaling the smoke
- Don't lose the flicking of the cigarette habit, because the app gives you the option to flick the ash off of it (also tricks are available)
- The time spent for smoking the virtual cigarette is similar to the real one, so you still get those smoking breaks that you are used to
- May not be for everyone, but if you still have a familiar feeling by seeing an ash tray, this is also included in the app :)
- Get rewards when you replace enough cigarettes

For many people, the habit of smoking just boils down not to the tobacco or nicotine within the cigarettes, but the feeling that you are in charge of your time, or you take advantage of the time to reflect and to think about current issues or problems. Or either for socializing with other people :) No matter the purpose, every smoker who tries to quit will miss that feeling they had when they took a smoking break. 

If you tried already giving up smoking, you know that you have to occupy your time with something to distract you, and to not think about lighting another cigarette. Well with this app, this would be easier, because it will occupy your time with something that you're already familiar with, the habbit of smoking without the cigarettes.

Try it every time you go for a smoking break, and instead of lighting a real cigarette, start smoking one in the app, and there will be at least one cigarette less in your lungs, and one more in the app.

Good luck quitting smoking! And remember, giving up bad habits is not actually quitting, because quitting is just a easy way out. What you are doing is remarkable!"

"According to Harvard Health Publications, more than half of the average person’s waking hours are spent sitting: watching television, working at a computer, commuting, or doing other physically inactive pursuits. But all that sitting could be sending us to an early grave—even those folks who exercise up to an hour a day.

 If Americans would cut their sitting time in half, their life expectancy would increase by roughly:
+  2 years (by reducing sitting to less than 3 hours a day)
+ 1.4 years (by reducing TV time to less than 2 hours a day)

"A keto diet is well known for being a low carb diet, where the body produces ketones in the liver to be used as energy. It’s referred to as many different names – ketogenic diet, low carb diet, low carb high fat (LCHF), etc. When you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose and insulin.

Glucose is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that it will be chosen over any other energy source. Insulin is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by taking it around the body. Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.

Ketosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low. During this state, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver. The end goal of a properly maintained keto diet plan is to force your body into this metabolic state. We don’t do this through starvation of calories but starvation of carbohydrates.

Our bodies are incredibly adaptive to what you put into it – when you overload it with fats and take away carbohydrates, it will begin to burn ketones as the primary energy source. Optimal ketone levels offer many health, weight loss, physical and mental performance benefits.

Benefits of a Ketogenic Diet.
There are numerous benefits that come with being on keto: from weight loss and increased energy levels to therapeutic medical applications. Most anyone can safely benefit from eating a low-carb, high-fat diet. Below, you’ll find a short list of the benefits you can receive from a ketogenic diet. 

The ketogenic recipes that have been prepared in this app are pure coming from ketogenic diet ingredients. These recipes are not only easy to cook but taste well as well. You'll be guided to find the ingredients and keep them on hand. If you plan ahead and pre-decide your meals, following the keto diet won’t be difficult. 

You have to be able to resist temptation. Be patient and you will definitely notice positive results in no time. Also, this diet helps you in losing fat from the abdominal region. Inside we collected only best of the best Ketogenic recipes for: Breakfast Main dishes, Lunch Side dishes, Desserts, Snacks, and appetizers.

“Now start moving from the bottom upwards with a stroking motion (start from the feet). In the calf area, add pressure - to improve lymph and blood flow.
Gradually increase the pace and force of pressure. Bear in mind, even if cellulite affects only the upper thigh, you should still work out the entire surface of the leg.
- Leave the intact areas of the lymph nodes, groin, popliteal and axillary hollows.
-To succeed, practice the massage 2-3 times a week (30-60 minutes each). A course of 8-10 procedures is more than enough.

Being a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over ""what if I forget?”.

Our app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.

Just click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.

Check your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.

Email us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!

* WHAT’S HIIT ? *
HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) is a method well known to burn fat in a short & intense workout. And there are many different ways to it : sprinting, crossfit, running, bodyweight workouts, cycling, yoga, stretching, weightlifting, boxing ... 

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an enhanced form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating periods of short intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 4–30 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition, improved glucose metabolism, and improved fat burning.
This definition comes from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) where you can find a lot more informations. It explains some very popular program, like the TABATA. HIIT is also a common practice in Crossfit trainings.


* HOW TO USE THE APP ? *
You can use it during all trainings with intervals or other timed repetition 

Basically, this is how it works : on the first screen you will set up your workout phases durations (preparation time, work, rest, rounds and cool down) and you will choose your sound.
Then hit “Go !”, work and just follow the sound… or the voice !
You can listen to your own music, just make sure you can still hear the sound.
At the end of the workout, a new feature allows you to share your workout with your friends on Facebook and Twitter @hiit_android 


* PHONE PERMISSIONS *
Now automatically pause and resume if a phone call arrives.
This is why PHONE_STATE permissions are required. But the app never collects and stores phone numbers from users phones."

"Custom Interval Timer helps you create workout timers that guide you through your exercise routines.

General Features
+ Create Timers that guide you through your workout.
+ Set Timer names, Interval names, Interval Times, and number of Rounds.
+ Gives voice, sound, and/or vibration feedback.
+ Customize the theme, font size, and font style.
+ Works in the background while using a different app or while screen is off.

Setup
You'll find that setting up a Timer is fairly straightforward. To create a Timer, you set up an Interval List. Set up an Interval List by adding Intervals to the list. Add as many Intervals to the Interval List as you'd like. Customize each Interval by giving it a name and a time to countdown from. You can cycle through the Interval List as many times as you'd like (1-99) by changing the Rounds number.

Playback Controls
Playing a Timer works much like a media player. You can play or pause the Timer. You can skip Forward to the next Interval or skip back to the previous one.

Feedback System
The feedback system lets you know where you are in your Timer. It notifies you of: the final 5 seconds of an Interval, the start of an Interval, the Round you're on, and the end of the Timer. This makes it seem like you have your own workout trainer, guiding you through your workout. You can be notified of these events by voice, sounds, and/or vibration.

The available options make Custom Interval Timer one of the best interval timer apps in the market. This customizable interval training timer is great for Running, Tabata, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Cycling, Weigh-Lifting, CrossFit, MMA training, Boxing, Yoga, Stretching, Home workouts, Fitness, Pilates and much more!
